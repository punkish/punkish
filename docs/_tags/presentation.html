            <summary>Back to the Future of Data Sharing</summary>
            <div class="notes">Scientists have always shared data, just not freely, and not with *anyone* who wants the data. For the most part, scientists have shared data with their collaborators, and on occasion, with those who might especially ask them for it. But as science has become more data-intensive, and as the technologies, mainly the network speeds and computing power, to collect, manage, analyze and visualize data, have become more powerful and ubiquitous, the sharing has not kept pace. The relatively recent awareness of intellectual property rights in data have at times brought about a contrarian change — scientists applying unsuitable licenses to their content creating an unintended but significant legal hurdle. All this confusion makes it seem that the goal of seamless data sharing between those who create it and those who want it may be moving further away from our grasp. So what is one to do? <a href="/Back-to-the-Future-of-Data-Sharing">more</a></div>

            <div class="notes">&lt;p&gt;The Biodiversity Literature Repository (BLR) is a research infrastructure developed by &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;http://plazi.org&quot; target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Plazi&lt;/a&gt; and its partners. It comprises the &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://zenodo.org/communities/biosyslit/?page&#x3D;1&amp;size&#x3D;20&quot; target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BLR Community on Zenodo&lt;/a&gt; hosted at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN), and services to search and retrieve the data such as &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://ocellus.info&quot; target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ocellus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://test.zenodeo.org&quot; target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zenodeo API&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://synospecies.plazi.org&quot; target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Synospecies&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://biolitrepo.org&quot; target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BLR website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BLR’s focus is on biodiversity data liberated from scholarly publications, and it uses custom metadata linking to external vocabularies covering the needs of the biodiversity community. BLR is the single largest community in Zenodo. Its data is widely reused, for example by the &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://gbif.org&quot; target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BLR is also conceived, built and managed to be open at every stage of data extraction/creation, production, and dissemination. In other words, it is &lt;em&gt;open by design&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <div class="notes">A lot of people talk of licensing data. That is usually not applicable (as data are not licensable, at least not on the basis of copyright), and it is also possibly misleading. There are just as much, if not more, important issues of integrity and ethics, in both gathering and sharing data that come into play, particularly if humans are involved (whether the humans are the ones gathering the data or humans are the subjects of the data gathering exercise). <a href="/Ethics-and-Integrity-of-Data-Collection-and-Sharing">more</a></div>

It brought together a few areas of the scientific community that represent fairly advanced infrastructure for archiving experiments and data (physicists and biomedical researchers) with two areas of the computer systems community for which significant progress is still needed (networks and compilers). The workshop also included experts in enabling technologies and publishing. <a href="/Interoperability-As-A-Guiding-Principle-For-Long-Term-Archives">more</a></div>

            <summary>Public Good v. Private Goods</summary>
            <div class="notes">The good news is that the private sector is taking over from the public agencies when it comes to innovation and investment in the medical/health domains. As such, the difficult but crucial technological advancements, especially when it comes to balancing the desire for sharing with the need for privacy, are going to come from the private sector. The bad thing is that we are already witnessing unintended side-effects to this. And the ugly part is that there will be many more undesirable consequences in the future. The necessary checks and balances—consent, governance, and reparations from harm—will have to come from the public sector, that is, both the government and the common people. <a href="/Public-Good-v-Private-Goods">more</a></div>

            <div class="notes">I gave a presentation at the GSDI9 conference in [Santiago de Chile]. The disconnect between most of the folks who think SDI and open source was very apparent.

            <summary>Who Owns My Data?</summary>
            <div class="notes">Ownership, legally defined as a bundle of rights in the thing that is owned, arises from some provision in either common law or in statute that gives us rights in that thing in the first place. We own land because we bought it or we inherited it from someone who bought it or either we or our ancestors laid claim to it in the absence of anyone else contesting our claim. Similarly, we own other property because we bought it we were gifted it or we inherited it. If there are competing claims to our property, our own claim is weakened until we can prove otherwise. We own statutory rights in intellectual property based on our authorship of that work with sufficient creativity. However, none of these characteristics define health data. We produce health data through the act of existing, but we don’t have any creativity in it. The only thing we have is a right to privacy that gives us the prerogative to deny the use of our data by others. The question then becomes – should we own our health data or not? and what would be implications of doing so one way or another? <a href="/Who-Owns-My-Data">more</a></div>
