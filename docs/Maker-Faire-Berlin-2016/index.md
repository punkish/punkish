## [DEploy](http://malpaux.com/deploy)

  A web-based drag-and-drop-and-connect application for programming IoT devices. Not open source, and not free-as-in-beer, but available as a free-tier for applications with fewer than a hundred devices. A good example of where programming is headed. Also available as applications for iOS and Android.

## [FabScan](http://fabscan.org)

  Build an open source 3D laser scanner. A Raspberry Pi 2 and a Raspberry Pi camera module are used to turn the FabScan PI into a stand-alone and web-enabled 3D Laser Scanner.

## [One Dollar Glasses](http://www.onedollarglasses.org)

  A design-jig for forming wire into frames for eyeglasses. Lenses in power ranging from +6.0 to -6.0 in 0.25 increments are bought in bulk from China. The cost of the complete pair is about a dollar. Active in 4-5 countries in Africa. Have already dispensed ~50K glasses through local entrepreneurs who set up a business to make and sell the glasses. The goal is to reach 150M people.

## [Fresh Square](http://www.fresh-square.com)

  Building a self-contained "just add water" kind of indoor home-gardening kit. Each kit provides measured, continuous irrigation and controlled LED lighting for 12 small pots in which different herbs and veggies may be grown.

## [3D Creationist](http://3dc.io)

  3D Creationist is the a browser-based (also desktop and mobile) app to create 3D models and 3D print them. It uses basic shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder, cone etc.) to create any 3D models. The designs can be exported as `.stl` or `.obj` files. The app seems to be free-as-in-beer but not sure about it being free-as-in-speech. In any case, along with [DEploy](#DEploy), this seems to be where programming is headed, in the browser, without requiring any downloads.

## [PlantIO](http://www.plantio.de)

  Plantio is aimed at gardening enthusiasts. Seems like a social network for gardeners helping them build an online community.

## [DIY Thermocam](http://www.diy-thermocam.net)

  An open-source thermal infrared camera, based on the FLIR Lepton sensor. There are various applications like finding heat leaks in the insulation of buildings, analysis of electrical or mechanical components, detection of persons / animals or even mounting it on a drone together with the additional video out module. The firmware, the USB protocol, the raw data files and the thermal viewer are completely open-source.

## [senseBox](http://www.sensebox.de)

  SenseBox is a kit for making an environmental sensing module that can measure temperature, humidity, air pressure, illuminance and UV (A) intensity. Expandable with additional sensors and Arduino-compatible hardware. No soldering required. Developed by the Institute for Geoinformatics at the University of Münster.

## [IHYA](https://www.kisskissbankbank.com/ihya-improve-hydraulic-yields-in-agriculture)

  Improve Hydraulic Yields in Agriculture (IYHA) is a low-cost, green, human size, modular desalination plant that works on solar power.
