sunlight dances shadow time upon the dappled leaves  
clouds are rolling inland with a hint of overseas

*a little trill, a pan tune in my head trying to tangle with the pulse…  
as a distant maxi with its Doppler calypso rumbled East…  
in tune with the mosquito bent upon telling me its secrets in a language I did not understand*

a syncopated rhythmical beating on the ground  
heart-throb of the tropical mysteries abound

*was this the sound of the heart-beat of the life soul…  
the gifts that I have… for whom…  
a reality of work, compassion, and a twisted ethic…  
am I good? am I bad? am I beautiful?  
what is beautiful?

a shekere of memories is keeping time with now  
pushing back the future past my cow bells and the cow
