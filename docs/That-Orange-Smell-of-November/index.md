I have traveled far afield,  
so distant from my kind  
Twisted warps of life that yield  
a window to my mind  

Far from start and far from end,  
anchor-less astray  
Endless travels do portend  
I may have lost my way  

Our differences are stark, well  
it was expected of course  
Different lives like parallels  
that have a single source  

Not decades but centuries,  
a canyon not a trench  
Cleaved by age and seven seas  
that we have to transcend  

A day of walks along the shores  
of thoughts and histories  
Dredges back up to the fore  
the sub-dermal unease  

Words can’t say what stones portray,  
the steps that sidewalks bore  
Left a print that poets pray  
can’t capture in their lore  

Screams of anguish serpentine  
that echo in our ear  
Where their blood like Sunday wine    
enriches the terroir  

Past that hangs like heavy capes  
and modulates the skin  
Bares our minds, our throats and napes  
and hearts that beat within  

Impatience creases our brow  
to start another new  
We do not know yet when or how,   
but we might know with who

Then a spark, a silence shared,  
words tentative that grow  
Strands of hope that gasp for air  
so frenzied life can slow  

We sit on ancient ledges  
tossing stones in pools of words  
And watch the ripples fade to edge as  
sentences in thirds  

Darkness flashes, rivers dance,  
I hold your hand in mine  
In that light I catch a glance,  
your lips curled like a twine  

Run your hand along the bone,  
your senses are askew  
You think that you fall alone  
but I am falling too  

A walk of thousand steps is followed  
by a thousand more  
Adding to the thousands that had  
taken place before  

Health won’t come from a single walk  
nor guarantee us love  
But it colors hundred talks  
from red to blue to mauve  

Wane then wax with elation  
like a pendulum  
Powered by infatuation’s  
surging momentum  

Sputter, surge, simmer, boil,  
overflow once more  
Falter, tripped by doubt and foil,  
back to lives of yore  

A journey that is broad and deep  
is necessarily long  
Buffeted by doubts that creep  
but dykes of faith are strong  

Like glue that holds this crumbling land  
this faith is not in vain  
Just as footsteps fade in sand  
but walks remain in grain

Make some space to grow or see  
thoughts inimical intrude  
Turn the noise down so we   
enjoy the quietude  

Standing at the edge that falls  
look up at sky we must  
As the act of flying calls  
for a major leap of trust  

I untie the knots that bind  
and trust my heart's refrain  
Walk with you so I can find  
my way back home again  

Plans nor fate predict the state  
that walks so well foretell  
Shifting winds will end our wait  
for November’s orange smell.
