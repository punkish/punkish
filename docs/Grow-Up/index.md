I met two street urchins and I asked them why  
they spent their time rummaging in a pig-sty  
and they said hey youve got money to blow  
we make a living out of things others throw  
	in landfill  
and I said why dont you grow up.  

It was just this morning that I decided to die  
and come back reincarnated as another guy  
who turned around and said hey why dont you show  
them why do you like to lie low 
	and still  
and I said why dont you grow up.  

Last night I dreamed of someone who was shy  
who would spend all the time using a sigh  
as a device to let other people know  
how exasperating it was to be called Joe  
	Hill  
and I said why dont you grow up.  

She was hungry so she ordered a pineapple pie  
and offered me a spoonful so I could try  
but I wrinkled my nose in order to show  
that I suddenly felt like I had to go  
	be ill  
and she said why dont you grow up.  

They sat on the roof under a pitch black sky  
and smoked and drank and got a bit high  
until the phone rang and she had to go  
with the back seat turned down so she could stow  
	a bicycle  
and I said why dont you grow up.
