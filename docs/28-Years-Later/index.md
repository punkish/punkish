I took this photo in 1985, (<strike>28</strike> 36 years ago), with a crappy, point-and-shoot, and developed the photo myself. She must have been barely 7, so today she must be a <strike>35</strike> 43 years old woman somewhere. I wonder what she would think if she saw this photo. I wonder if she even knows of the web. I would love to meet her.
