The institution was designed  
to cleave the citizen from the science  
Now watch the academics then  
steal science away from citizens  

To take away what is not theirs  
They must pay up for that is fair  
But the powerful do make the rules  
For science outside and in the schools  
  
The citizens have to pay the price  
To borrow once and share it thrice  
But academia gets paid to do  
Science in the names of me and you  
  
In vain they’ll have their lives doth striven  
For those who hath more shall be given  
And citizens will still lack their share  
Unless they claim what is just theirs
