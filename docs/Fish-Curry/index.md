Some of the ingredients may be hard to find, so I have provided substitutes in parentheses

## Ingredients

1. 5 whole dry red chillies (1.5 t red chillies powder)
2. 0.75 c dry coconut, not sweetened
3. 1 t cumin seeds (0.5 t cumin powder)
4. 1 T coriander seeds (2 t coriander powder)
5. 1 large onion
6. 0.25 c oil
7. a sprig of [curry leaves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry_tree) 
    (you can find this only in an Indian store. If you can’t, well 
    there is no substitute. You will just have to do without them).
8. half a can of diced tomatoes, about 1/2 a pound
9. 4 green chillies slit lengthwise
10. 1 T tamarind paste
11. 1 T salt, more or less to taste
12. 2 pounds any white fish chopped into pieces, or shrimp

## Directions

* Grind chillies, coconut, cumin and coriander into a paste, adding a little water from time to time. 
* Grate the onion. Now, grinding the first four by themselves is tricky because I don’t have any dry spices grinder. So, I chop the onion and put it in a [grinder/dicer](http://bit.ly/R5NPSz) — and then add the chillies, coconut, cumin and coriander to the onion and grind it all together.
* Fry the onion in the oil till golden brown, then add the coconut paste. However, if you have combined everything and ground them into a paste together for ease, then fry it all together till it is golden brown, and the oil starts showing separately. This will take about 5-8 mins. Really, the hardest part is done.
* Add curry leaves and tomatoes + 0.25 c water, and cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally.
* Add green chillies, tamarind and salt + 1 c water and bring to a boil.
* Add fish and cook for 2-3 mins. Fish will get done really quickly.

Serve hot with white rice.
