This recipe serves: 4    
    
* 1 qt water  
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil  
* 1 1/2 cup red lentils, rinsed in a strainer  
* 3/4 tsp salt  
* 1 qt boiling water  
* 2 1/2 cup unsweetened desiccated coconut  
* 1 tbsp unsalted butter  
* 1 ea onion, diced  
* 4 ea garlic clove, minced  
* 1 tsp fresh gingerroot, minced  
* 1 tsp ground turmeric  
* 1 tsp ground coriander  
* 1 tsp ground cumin  
* 1 dash cayenne pepper  
* 1 ea lime, juiced     

Estimated Time: 40min  
  
1. Combine the water, oil, lentils, and salt in a large saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook 20 minutes, stirring often. 

2. Meanwhile make the coconut milk by combining the hot water and coconut in a blender or food processor and blending it for 2 minutes. In batches, pour it through a strainer over a large bowl and press out as much milk as you can from the coconut by using the back of a large spoon. Discard the coconut pulp. Mix the coconut milk into the lentil mixture and simmer 20 minutes, stirring frequently. 
 
3. Melt the butter in a medium size skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger and saute until the onion is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle in the spices and "toast" them 2 minutes. Scrape this mixture into the soup, then add the juice of the lime. Cook the soup 10 more minutes, stirring often. The soup is done when the lentils have dissolved. (If you make the soup in advance, a good idea to help develop the flavors; it will get thick when it cools. After reheating it over low heat, check the consistency. If it is too thick, thin it with a little water.)
