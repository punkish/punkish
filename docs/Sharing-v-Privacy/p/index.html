## The Sword

# Data


---

## The Two Edges

.two-left-column[
  ## Sharing

  Clinicians and researchers needing access to data are unable to do so easily, or not at all, given the onerous privacy requirements they have to meet.

]

.two-right-column[
  ## Privacy

  Protecting privacy is important as it is a crucial component of trust, and without trust we would have no sharing.

]

---

## The Two Edges

<img src="img/Summary-Findings/img/logo_nuffield.png" align="left" style="padding: 10px 20px 0px 0px;"> **Sharing** and **privacy** are “are mutually implicated in each other: there are private interests in the achievement of common goals and a public interest in the protection of privacy that encourages cooperation.”

—The Nuffield Council on Bioethics

---

## The Privacy Imperative v. Emphasizing Sharing

<img src="img/Summary-Findings/img/sharingvprivacyclips.jpg" width="100%">

> Instead of emphasizing the intricacies of privacy to the citizen from whom the data are being sourced, if alongwith providing a reasonable assurance to protect privacy we were to also communicate the potential benefits of sharing, then the citizen would be more inclined to give consent to sharing.

## Four Sessions

<details open>
  <summary>Ethics</summary>
  <p>Can privacy requirements be trumped, and if yes, under what conditions? Can we waive our right to genomic privacy, and if not, when is this right not waiveable? Should we strive only for adequate privacy?</p>
</details>

<details open>
  <summary>Encouraging Data Sharing</summary>
  <p>This session reflected on why we want access to data, what data should be made accessible? What limits should be placed on who can use the data and for what? What are the risks associated with breach?</p>
</details>

<details open>
  <summary>Engagement Tools</summary>
  <p>Organizing an effective research study is complex. The “legal stack” alone can have many interconnected components such as informed consent, privacy policy, terms of use, DUAs, IRBs. Tools can help.</p>
</details>

<details open>
  <summary>Protocols</summary>
  <p>The final session focused on communications with citizens, the source of the data, and how to involve them in decision-making via mechanisms of  inclusive governance and deliberative democracy.</p>

**Minimum Viable Dataset:** The least amount of data that, if shared, would benefit research

**Social Contract:** creates a trusted environment for research through a patient's obligation to share data *and* a researcher's obligation to use data properly

]

**Patient's obligation to share data:** *I might benefit from the knowledge gained from the data of others therefore I should share my data so others may benefit.*

**Researcher's obligation to use data:** in accordance with the wishes of the patient—*I have been entrusted with someone else's data so I should not violate that trust and use the data with respect for and in accordance with the wishes of the source of the data*

A revised social contract for health research that focuses on the creation of trusted environments for research. Such a contract would spell out reasonable privacy expectations in different research contexts, enable sustained engagement between the research and its participants, and promote a sharing culture through fulfilling mutual responsibilities of both the participants and the researchers.

Researchers should sign up to a social contract to not re-identify.

## The False Promise of Anonymization

> Anonymization is increasingly easily defeated by the very techniques that are being developed for many legitimate applications of big data. In general, as the size and diversity of available data grows, the likelihood of being able to re‐identify individuals (that is, re‐associate their records with their names) grows substantially. While anonymization may remain somewhat useful as an added safeguard in some situations, approaches that deem it, by itself, a sufficient safeguard need updating.

—PCAST. 2014. Big Data and Privacy: A Technological Perspective.

---

## The False Promise of Consent

> Only in a fantasy world do users actually read the consent notices and understand their implications. The conceptual problem with notice and consent is that it fundamentally places the burden of privacy protection on the individual. Notice and consent creates a non‐level playing field in the implicit privacy negotiation between provider and user. The provider offers a complex, take‐it‐or‐leave‐it set of terms, while the user, in practice, can allocate only a few seconds to evaluating the offer. This is a kind of market failure.
