## dawn

a hesitant flame crackles at  
the bottom of the wall  
that stretches from this end to the  
end of the other hall  

an easterly gust of breeze  
with fetid sacred smells  
carries home tinkling of  
the tarnished copper bells  

the flickering flame found second life  
passionately burns  
two shivering souls warm their bones  
taking second turns  

cutting through the swarthy din  
a ray of multi-hue  
the writer and the poet and  
the painter to rescue  

words spill out, images flash  
a conundrum is spun  
lines are drawn, battles lost  
bigger wars are won  

sweet repose, a momentâ€™s rest  
subdued and solemn mood  
chaotic thoughts, tumbling forth  
illogical intrude  

arms entwined in a tender clasp  
two souls one whole again  
open minds, shut the eyes  
block out all the pain  

go off to sleep deep in the arms  
to the beating of the heart  
in rhythm with the coming of  
another hopeful start  

the rooster crows at the crack of dawn  
gets its wattle wet  
scooting chicks by mother hen  
another day might let  

a flash of sun, yellow bright  
beneath the green of tree  
conversing with the brown and red and  
other colors three  

so many thoughts the noises make  
it difficult to scan  
these straining words, its time to ring  
a fanfare for the silent man
