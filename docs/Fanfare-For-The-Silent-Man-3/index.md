## night may bring hope

the silent man, the silent man  
said not a word today  
oh fie, oh fie, he must have had  
at least a word to say  

the running child calls his name  
he does not turn around  
he does not listen, he does not stop  
he must have heard the sound  

strangely so, he lets it go  
a shuffling askance  
walks away the other way  
without a backward glance  

look inside, peel the layers  
use a keener lens  
sifting through the garbage for  
an iota of sense  

listen for a reason, think  
what he might have meant  
detect a tiny motion of  
a deeper discontent  

he may be tired, he may be caught  
in a longer term-ish mood  
he may want to chat with them  
or he may want to brood  

he may have a plan of work  
that he may think he can  
think it through until it’s time  
for him to work the plan  

he may have had a friend of late  
who used to come around  
now it’s just a faint mistrust  
a feeble protest sound  

in all this din they’re crying out  
“c’mon, let boredom brew!”  
it’s not good you’re trying to  
be another you  

rationale of humans  
lives a living death  
words contort, gasping short  
a life that ends with breath  

chariots of fallen gods  
sagging at their sails  
commiserate with earthly lords  
confusion prevails  

end of the day might bring reprieve  
or silence at the least  
such hope alone unconvincing in  
the bosom of the beast
