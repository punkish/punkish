    <div class="content"><p>Amazing grace, how bitter-sweet this sounds on Pentecost;<br />
I thought that I was found, but once again it seems I'm lost.</p>
<p>An impatient gestation, twenty years of labour pain<br />
and struggle; it is silly to be born yet once again.</p>
<p>Ironically la petite-morte conceives a quo pro quid;<br />
a darkness-filled mind greys into a smart alecky kid</p>
<p>reflecting on the strange dichotomy of everyday;<br />
why pins pointed in one direction are headed the other way,</p>
<p>on the bumpy Highway 7 in a little cramped red car<br />
with a newly found love for life and an old friend from afar.</p>
<p>A shimmering cloud of dusty heat makes my throat to shrink<br />
as noises fill my head and make it difficult to think.</p>
<p>I think of all that I have got, yet  not a thing to show<br />
'cause they see what they want to see, to die it is they grow.</p>
<p>The have-nots give new birth to hope, to change, and to be free.<br />
while ich will alles so dead of mind, the irony kills me…</p>
<p>A yo-yo's life of boom and bust in monotonic time;<br />
who cares who scorches, dries, or dies, the night is "gin and lime."</p>
<p>With aisles of cat-n-dog food for our pedigreed pet whim,<br />
we stuff ourselves in a twilight getting complacently dim;</p>
<p>making the most of rations for an evening's big fling<br />
by singing sixty's sing-alongs on budgeted six strings.</p>
<p>The sated mind breeds ills with which the frugal meal is fraught;<br />
a joke and the empty chair provide a lot more food for thought.</p>
<p>We who want our slaves to help us wear our freedom's crown<br />
must remember what goes down comes up as what goes up comes down;</p>
<p>the familiar is distracting, is disturbing, living dead,<br />
fecundity unbounded like a toppling-heavy head</p>
<p>that carries in its decapitated, blank, unseeing eyes,<br />
a numbing whitewashed nothingness that just can't hide the lies.</p>
<p>But in this deadening life there stems an urge to rearrange—<br />
not a tired change of permanence but a permanence of change;</p>
<p>a gentle, soft caress, a touch with strength rejuvenates<br />
and drums up a new verse upon the fairly smudged up slate.</p>
<p>A song, a tune, words whimpered to a purr between the hands<br />
in a language that sounds magical 'cause I can't understand,</p>
<p>urges me to listen to the rhythm in my heart<br />
and see with open eyes, a compelling difficult art</p>
<p>looking up across the worldly blue dome of my eyes<br />
with acid rain of tears snaking sperm-like from the skies</p>
<p>that washes clean all I have known with a caustic biting pain;<br />
a Tabula Rasa capable of giving birth again.</p>
<p>Ground to zero, naked in the knowledge I'm alone<br />
fixed as the base that bears the line that's etched an arc in stone.</p>
<p>my homecoming churns up the muck in which He tiredly plods;<br />
I've grown up, now it's time for me to rearrange my gods.</p>
<p>It takes me by surprise again, indeed the truth is strange<br />
you created, you have caused it.  hey! you are the change.</p>
<p>and what breeds change better than the mind that's on a spin…<br />
cogito ergo sum… but… I am what I imagine.</p>
<p>This one is inspired by my source of joy and strife,<br />
my sweet imagination, my afflatus… it's my life.</p></div>
