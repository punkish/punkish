## Property vs Privacy vs IP Laws

.left-column[
### Property
]
.right-column[
> Property encompasses a range of legal rights and entitlements, including <span class="hilite">the right to exclude others from, and the right to profit from, sell, dispose of or destroy one’s property</span>. These various rights (and there are many more) are often referred to as a “bundle” of rights or, more colorfully, a bundle of sticks.
]

---

## Property vs Privacy vs IP Laws

.left-column[
### Property  
### Privacy
]
.right-column[
> Privacy law is protective of individuals, like laws against assault and battery. Privacy law may prevent someone from taking your photograph without your permission, or from disclosing embarrassing facts about you. <span class="hilite">Privacy is based in tort law, rather than property</span> (tort, property and contract being the three big common law civil disciplines, i.e., not criminal).
]

## Property vs Privacy vs IP Laws

.left-column[
### Property  
### Privacy
### IP
]
.right-column[
> Intellectual property (patent, copyright, trademarks and trade secrets) are yet another category. Despite being called intellectual “property,” these rights do not derive from common law, but from statute. In the U.S., Art 1, Sec. 8.8 of the Constitution authorizes Congress to enact IP laws, and they have done so. So their basis is purely statutory. Interestingly, <span class="hilite">there is no statutory protection in the U.S. for data or databases</span> (unlike Europe). Thus, those wishing to protect individual medical data must rely on common law property or privacy theories to achieve their ends.

## Statutory vs Common vs Natural

.left-column[
### Statutory
]
.right-column[
> Statutory law or statute law is written law set down by the legislature. It is fairly meaningless to say that we have a right if there’s no way to enforce it. The court will enforce a right if there is a statute establishing the right and the process of enforcement.
]

## Statutory vs Common vs Natural

.left-column[
### Statutory
### Common
]
.right-column[
> In the US and England,  common-law is a set of principles and precedents that the courts of the land have discerned, one way or another, over time.
]

## Statutory vs Common vs Natural

.left-column[
### Statutory
### Common
### Natural
]
.right-column[
> Natural law is stuff like “All men are … endowed by their Creator with the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” The thing is, unless the Creator gets the legislature and courts on its side, to interpret, delimit and confirm those rights, there’s no way they can be realized.

.right-column[
> That there “is no property in data” is in many circumstances false. Although intellectual property (IP) is a matter of national law and can vary by nation, research data are often considered IP and are covered as a trade secret, or copyrighted. This raises an interesting point as to whether an individual’s data, say from a medical device, constitute a new kind of research and could be considered IP of the individual, or whether they are just a set of facts. As we move toward precision medicine, personal data will take on much greater value, and we expect that laws will need to adjust.

Real property normally requires a verified signature in order to be transferred. In other contexts, our identities have recognized value, and there are laws that protect the use of our likeness, our image, our voice and other information derived from us. The bottom line is that personal data are already viewed as property in a variety of contexts.

This approach would shift the landscape from one in which data-based research cannot occur without the consent of individual research participants to one in which research is presumptively allowed, but researchers face liability for overstepping the bounds of permitted activity.

That is, a property rule establishes entitlements whose infringement can only be avoided with the advance permission of the rights holder. A liability rule, on the other hand, only gives rise to a remedy when someone violates its strictures.

### From Sharing v. Privacy to Sharing *and* Privacy<sup>*</sup>

.footnote[
<span class="red">*</span> Findings from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation sponsored Creative Commons workshop on <a href="http://punkish.org/science/sharingvprivacy/" target="_blank">Sharing v. Privacy</a> held in Feb 2015 in Washington DC.
]

--

Instead of absolute privacy, contextually adequate privacy should be assured.

--

A new social contract between the patient and the researcher balancing the need for individual privacy with the desire for sharing data for social good.

--

A new *Belmont Report* to account for the rapidly blurring distinction between research and clinical setting as well as spaces outside of those two.

--

Information should not be de-identified, but the researchers should agree to not re-identify.

--

We need to identify a minimal viable dataset (MVD) for sharing rather than all data.

--

Researchers should have a choice of IRBs. We need to identify the attributes that are common to a new kind of IRBs.

--

Instead of consent, *engagement* should be emphasized.

--

Patients, clinicians, researchers, and toolmakers, all need to be a part of the shared governance.
