Wind me up, Spin me like a top  
Throw me in the air, Catch me in your hand

String me out, Pull me behind you  
Catch me a breeze, Lift me into the sun

Throw me hard, Knock me over  
Across the field where the grass is wild

Take away my wheels till I'm balanced on one  
Lift me if I fall and set me back again

Crank up the fire well beyond max  
Singe me in the flames of your obsession

But firstâ€¦

Take me to Jerusalem and buy me a wallet  
So I may keep you close to my heart
