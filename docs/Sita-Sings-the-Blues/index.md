Meet [Nina Paley](http://www.ninapaley.com/bio.html).

She followed her American husband to India, got divorced by him via an email, wrote a screenplay of her life based on the Ramayana, and [scripted, animated, filmed and edited it on her home computer](http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/).

Then she [landed in an intellectual property minefield](http://blog.ninapaley.com/2008/09/13/am-i-a-criminal/) because of the music she used in her film. But she [survived that minefield](http://blog.ninapaley.com/2008/12/28/sitas-distribution-plan/) with the help of Copyleft, the concept popularized by the Free Software Foundation.

Finally, see [Sita Sings the Blues](http://www.thirteen.org/sites/reel13/indies/indie-sita-sings-the-blues/241/).
