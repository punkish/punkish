This recipe originally accompanied ThaiCurryPenne.

* 1/4 cup rice vinegar
* 1/4 cup golden brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon minced peeled fresh ginger
* 1 14 1/2 ounce can diced tomatoes in juice
* 1 cinnamon stick 

Combine vinegar, brown sugar and ginger in small saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Add tomatoes with juices and cinnamon. Bring mixture to boil. Reduce heat; simmer uncovered until chutney is slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Discard cinnamon. (Chutney can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over low heat or bring to room temperature before using.) 

Makes about 1 cup.
