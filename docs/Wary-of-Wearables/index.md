Though [the sweet spot for sensors](Taxonomy-of-Sensors) probably remains outside "personal," there may be use for personal data in the four general spheres of health:

![four spheres](img/four-spheres.png)

<!--
* self
* clinical
* community
* public
-->

The following are my empirical generalizations from the [QSPH summit at UCSD early April](http://quantifiedself.com/symposium/Symposium-2014/). 

* Most people are not interested in quantifying themselves.
* Measuring oneself will remain of interest as a novelty, or to those who need the measures, that is, folks training for an event, or faced with a condition that requires monitoring, either doing so themselves or because their doctor asked them.
* Fragmented tech landscape means none of them will reach scale.
* Silo-fication means users are faced with the onerous task of wearing multiple trackers that don't talk to each other and thus provide an incomplete or incoherent view.
* There are signs [people][0] and [manufacturers][1] may already be [tiring][3] of wearables
* The wearables market is just [not as big as the smartphone][2] market
* Perhaps the move will be toward [software and services that coalesce around smartphone-based apps][4] such as [RunKeeper's new Breeze app][7] and [Moves app][6] that announced "the launch of Moves 2.0 for the iPhone… (bringing) with it [support for Apple’s M7 motion coprocessor][6] in the iPhone 5s for increased tracking accuracy and a new battery saving mode for an increase of up to 40% in battery life." 
* Integration into other platforms such as [Moves being acquired by Facebook][5]
* Doctors are not interested in continuous data collection. Clinical utility of data is episodic and individualized. ([National Research Council. *Computational Technology for Effective Health Care: Immediate Steps and Strategic Directions.* Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2009.][8])
* Clinicians don't need all the data from everyone all the time. They need *specific data* from *specific people* at *specific times* for *specific duration*.
* Decouple acquisition of data from delivery of intervention.

Individual-level data could be useful for self– and clinical-care, and aggregate data for community– and public-health. But significant questions and challenges remain along the entire [information lifecycle](Information-Lifecycle).
