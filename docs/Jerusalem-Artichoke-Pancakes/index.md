 Adapted from Michael Romano of Union Square Cafe

 Time: 30 minutes
* 2 small onions, peeled and quartered 
* 3 pounds Jerusalem artichokes, scrubbed and trimmed 
* 2 large eggs 
* 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup 
* 2 tablespoons walnut or hazelnut oil 
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
* 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 
* 1 cup all purpose flour 
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil (more if needed) 
* 2 tablespoons butter.

1. Line 2 baking sheets with waxed paper or aluminum foil. Grate onions and artichokes in food processor with shredder attachment or by hand on box grater. Transfer to a roasting pan or large bowl.

2. Crack eggs into a small bowl. Add maple syrup, nut oil, salt, peppers and nutmeg. Whisk together and pour onto grated vegetables. Mix lightly with fingers. Sprinkle flour over surface and mix lightly with fingers. Form into 16 3 inch pancakes aboutâ€ 1/2 inch thick, placing each on a baking sheet when it is shaped.

3. In a large heavy bottomed skillet or griddle, heat half the vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Cook half the pancakes until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes a side. If pancakes brown too quickly, lower heat to cook them through. If skillet or griddle becomes dry, add more oil. Remove pancakes to paper towel lined baking sheet. Add remaining oil and butter and cook remaining pancakes. Cover finished pancakes loosely with foil, and hold in a warm oven until ready to serve.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
