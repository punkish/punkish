## Why

We all talk about accessibility and freedom, but what does it actually mean?

???

Can we recognize free when we see it? Can we measure accessibility? Can we rate one source of information as being more or less accessible than another?

There is no consensus on information, let alone on information accessibility, yet we talk about it, profess and promote it, lament its absence and fear its demise, and base policies on it. This is a proposal to define and measure information accessibility.

---

## What we know

*   Information production, sharing and use are increasing very rapidly \[1]
*   Modes of information production, sharing and use are changing \[2]
*   Technological, legal and other mechanisms to restrict information sharing are also increasing \[3]
*   Restrictions are exacerbated when information crosses national and jurisdictional boundaries \[4]

<hr>

*   \[1] Gantz 2008; Lyman and Varian 2003
*   \[2] Benkler 2007; Weber 2005
*   \[3] Mccurry et al. 2006; NRC 2003
*   \[4] Special 301 Report  2007

???

Technology is making both creation, sharing and use as well restriction possible. Technology is also changing the cultural expectations of what is ok and what is not, and changing the economics of the entire information chain.

---

## What we believe

*   Restriction to information can stifle both of the above \[1]
*   Access to information is necessary for both the scientific process as well as for entrepreneurship

<hr>

*   \[1] Lessig 2001


---

## A reasonable assumption

Information !will be produced and shared! with increasing ease, while access to and use of information !can and will be restricted! with increased vigilance.

In this scenario, being able to quantify or otherwise indicate the extent of accessibility of information would be a reasonably useful capability whether one is advocating freedom or restriction of information.

   
---

## What I advocate

*   Increase information accessibility
*   Specify different ways in which accessibility can be increased

<hr>

*   The above is a reasonable expectation, and has policy implications.

   
---

## What I don't know

*   How can I scientifically measure information accessibility?
*   How do I determine if the attempts to increase information accessibiility are successful?

<hr>

*   The above is the motivation for this proposal.

   
---

## Not just my problem

*   Measuring and specifying levels of information accessibility seems to be very difficult \[1]
*   Not only do we not have an established method to measure information accessibility, we don't even have an established definition of information accessibility \[1]

<hr>

*   \[1] Peterson Bishop 1998

   
---

## Potential benefits of being able to measure accessibility

*   Evaluate compliance with open access regulations
*   Enable flow to the public of benefits from information created with public funds
*   Invigorate entrepreneurship
*   Make the scientific process more efficient via reduced duplication, fewer resources spent on collecting information, etc.
*   Identify conditions that make for more accessible information

<hr>

*   The above are assertions, and have policy implications.


---

## The Bigger Picture

*   Information fuels science, science fuels innovation, innovation is the life-blood of entrepreneurism
*   Open access to information can lead to innovative results \[1-3]
    *   "Publicly available data was significantly ... associated with a 69% increase in citations, independently of journal impact factor, date of publication, and author country of origin." \[4]

<hr>

*   \[1] Lakhani, *et. al.* 2007
*   \[2] "Density Hales-Jewett" Theorem described in Rehmeyer 2009
*   \[3] a seven years old initiative on sharing of data to find the biological markers of Alzheimer's disease described in Kolata 2010
*   \[4] Piwowar 2010

   
---

## The Bigger Picture... is cloudy

*   But open access to data is threatened \[1]

<hr>

*   \[1] Reichman and Uhlir 2003

   
---

## Things are not what they seem

"Mars Inc. Cacao Genome Database claims Open Access, public domain: falls short" \[1]

*   Claims to be public domain
*   Funded by USDA, and collaborators from IBM, Clemson University; University of California-Davis; National Center for Genome Resources; Indiana University; HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology; and Washington State University
*   Yet, has license restrictions of all kinds
    *   no mention of commercial use
    *   "anytime the User consults the data base through the cocoa genome database web site, he/she shall be bound to the same obligations under this IAA. Should the User store the information and data for future use he/she shall be bound to the same obligations under this IAA"
    *   "The User shall not transfer the information referred to in this agreement, or any copy of them, to a third party without obtaining written authorization from the Providers which will only be provided subject to the third party user entering into this same IAA"
    *   "The User shall not claim legal ownership over the information and data found in the data base nor seek intellectual property protection under any form over these information, data and data base. For clarity, the user agrees not to claim any of the sequences disclosed in these databases in any patent application"

<hr>

## Steps

*   Define information in general
*   Define information in science
*   Define information accessibility
*   Define indicators of it
*   Identify a problem domain and a study set
*   Measure the !intensity! of indicators for the study set
*   Rank elements of study set on the information accessibility scale
*   Validate results

   
---

## Define information

*   I will define !datum! as a descriptor of a tangible thing or an intangible idea
*   When that datum is used to assert a state about what it describes, that is !information!
*   In keeping with DoD's assertion, meaning derived from data is information, but that information can also be a part of data at another level \[1]
*   This is an important characteristic of information: information is the raw material for more information.

<hr>

\[1] ATIS Telecom Glossary 2007

   
---

## Information in science

*   Data
    *   Raw data
    *   Interpreted data
*   Software
    *   Source code
    *   Binary
*   Literature
    *   Grey literature
        *   slideshows, videos, audio files, photographs, working papers
    *   Formal literature
        *   reviewed papers, book chapters, monographs, conference proceedings

   
---

## Information restriction in science

*   Different reasons for restricting \[1]
*   Scientists motivated by different reasons in different fields and at different stages in their career \[2]

<hr>

*   \[1] 1999 meeting on !Secrecy in Science! organized by the AAAS Committee on Scientific Freedom and Responsibility
*   \[2] AAAS 2007

   
---

## Information accessibility

Information is the very basis of science, it is its raw material, and its final product. Science informs us, it affects our existing assertions and enables us to make new assertions.

It stands to reason that the more easily we can get to more information, the more likely we will be able to expeditiously proceed in our scientific quest.

   
---

## But, what do we mean by information accessibility

*   Is it not available at all? 
*   Is it difficult to understand? 
*   Is it not documented? 
*   Does it have to be paid for, and is its price too high? 
*   Is it encrypted? 
*   Is its reuse constrained by onerous legal clauses and expectations of reciprocal obligations?

   
---

## Five factors affecting accessibility

*   Culture
    *   is it acceptable?
*   Law
    *   is it legal?
*   Technology
    *   is it possible?
*   Semantics
    *   is it understandable?
*   Economics
    *   is it affordable?

<hr>

*   The above are loosely based on the Creative Commons licenses that are offered in three formats: human readable, legal text, and machine parsable. The addition of culture and economics rounds out the indicators from a social perspective.

   
---

## Indicators

![indicators of accessibility](indicators w=683 h=233)

   
---

## The case for culture

*   Culture makes it !acceptable!
    *   academics cite each others' works without being required legally \[1]
    *   kids download music and videos, genuinely surprised that it is possibly illegal to do so
    *   Programmers create and share programs based on internal motivations such as fom  altruism, community identification, ego-gratification and learning

<hr>

*   \[1] Science Commons, a project of Creative Commons, the non-profit creator of the immensely popular Creative Commons licenses, based its recently released CC0 protocol for scientific data on the "use of scientific norms to express the wishes of the data provider"
*   \[2] Hars and Ou 2001; Lerner and Tirole 2002; Hertel, Niedner, and Herrmann 2003


---

## The case for law

*   Law makes it !legal! via instruments such as
    *   Patents protect a specific expression of an idea for a device or a technique
    *   Trade secrets protect proprietary and strategic information
    *   Trademarks and service marks display proprietorship in the mark and its associated use
    *   Copyright licenses are unilateral restrictions on the use of the content
    *   Contracts are agreements between two parties stating the obligations of both


---

## The case for technology

*   Technology makes it !possible!
    *   Implement implement distribution or protection mechanisms \[1]
    *   Technology also makes barriers possible
        *   information format not amenable to digital dissemination
        *   not having it on a publicly reachable server
        *   not available at convenient times
        *   requiring a convoluted and onerous authentication procedure as a prerequisite to access
        *   opaque data formats
        *   lack of documentation or software tools to unpack and digest information
        *   an onerous, non-standard process for data extraction

<hr>

*   \[1] Awre and Jacobs 2006


---

## The case for semantics

*   Semantics makes it !understandable!
    *   not just !"poe-tah-toe" vs. "poe-tay-toe"!
    *   making information amenable to manipulation with the help of software programs, a vision of the semantic web \[1]
    *   adding useful metadata to it
    *   for eg., Wikipedia vs. DBPedia \[2]

<hr>

*   \[1] Halb, Raimond, and Hausenblas 2008
*   \[2] Auer et al. 2007


---

## The case for economics

*   Economics makes it !affordable!
    *   monetary restriction imposed on information by simply charging for it
    *   while recouping the cost of collecting, creating, managing and making information available and even profiting from doing so is understandable, doing so for publicly funded information is double-dipping
    *   the average price of scientific journals in social and biomedical sciences increased by 39% between 2000 and 2006, more than twice as much as the increase in the retail price index in that period \[1]
    *   coupled with budget cuts at libraries, a grim outlook was predicted for the ability of libraries to provide timely information to its users \[2]

## Forest models as a focus group


*   A well-defined field and group of practioners
*   History, literature, culture
*   As science-y as science can be
*   Data, lots of data, much of it by necessity from outside sources
*   Small dataset (between 50 and 100)

   
---

## Studying Forest Models

*   Very highly parameterized
*   Requiring many data values that may be difficult to obtain
*   Many of the underlying assumptions in most of the models are the same, yet researchers create new models, replicating much of the work done by others

> "scientists (should) share code for different forest models to avoid duplication, so their effort can focus on the parts of the model that really vary" \[1]

<hr>

*   \[1] Landsberg and Gower 1997

   
---

## Topical

Because of the increased interest in carbon calculations driven by the concerns over global climate change, ecosystem process models are also crossing over into the realm of entrepreneurism, as modelers are taking steps toward commercializing the processes or the service delivery of the processes.

## Steps

*   Identify the study set
*   Create a questionnaire-based survey that measures the models per the factors
*   Administer the questionnaire
*   Conduct open-ended survey of the impression of openness of !other! models
*   Analyze results

   
---

## Analysis


*   Since I have already decided on the indicators of accessibility, the first problem is simple &mdash; measure them
*   However, the dependent variable (free or restricted) depends on the viewpoint of the viewer

   
---

## Strategy


*   Use Charles Ragin's Quantitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) \[1]
*   Suitable for small sets and fuzzy sets (fsQCA)
*   Assumes that not any one but many different conditions occurring concurrently affect the outcome &mdash; !causal conjunctures! in Ragin's words
*   Favorably reviewed for its suitability for studying small sample sets,  especially when the responses are not many and also not very varied \[2]
*   Precedent for using it for measuring improvisation, closely tied to innovation \[3]

<hr>

*   \[3] Miner, Bassoff, and Moorman 2001

   
---

## Quantitative Comparative Analysis


*   Ask questions that have binary (yes|no) answers
*   If a question is not binary, reformulate it so it does become a binary question
*   Construct a truth-table
*   Discard causal conditions that contradict the outcome variable
*   Narrow down the contradictions to build a combinatorial model with a minimum of causal combinations with contradictory outcomes.

## Expected End Result


*   A set of conditions that can provide a reliable measure of the openness of infromation of a particular information source
*   A methodology to measure information accessibility of information sources allowing comparison between them


---

## Expected Difficulties


*   Nearly impossible to create a control group to study conditions of both restrictive as well as easily accessible information
*   All indicators are ordinal, which is not terribly useful
*   The indicators are not uniform in their measure of openness
*   There is no reliable and accurate ground-truthing method other than the opinions of those involved with the models
*   Scientists are likely to respond differently when talking about their own data, that is, as data publishers, than when talking about data from others, that is, as data consumers
*  The independent variables are measurable, but the dependent variables are, for the most part, opinion
*   Freeness can't be measured unless defined, and the way it is defined decides how and what can be measured
