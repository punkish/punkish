## Sensored City

Funded by a generous grant from Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, we are working with the City of Louisville to design and implement a network of sensor-based hardware that will collect environmental data and drive a public installation of data-driven art. [more &rarr;](/Sensored-City)

## Sharing vs. Privacy

Funded by a generous grant from Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, we are working with our partners to explore the potential of shifting the conversation from privacy to sharing to encourage data sharing. [more &rarr;](/Sharing-v-Privacy)

## Open Hardware

Funded by a generous grant from Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, we are evaluating the available open licensing options for their strengths and weaknesses, with an emphasis on distributed sensing hardware. Our goal is to produce a whitepaper that will become the authoritative reference for open hardware developers when choosing their licensing strategy. [more &rarr;](/Open-Hardware)
    
## Text and Data Mining

TDM is increasingly becoming an important scientific technique for analyzing large corpora of articles. The technique is used to uncover both existing and new insights in unstructured data sets that typically are obtained programmatically from many different sources.

## Terms of Services

Everyone agrees to them, no one understands them. Terms of Services (TOS) are ubiquitous and inversely understood. We are working to create a standardized and easily understandable TOS that pulls in various different and complementary concepts. [more &rarr;](/Terms-of-Services)

## Dashboard

All our work viewable on a timeline and a map. [more &rarr;](/Dashboard)
