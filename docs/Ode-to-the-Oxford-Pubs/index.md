The Turf, The Bear, The Eagle and Child  
  A beer to share, a place to get wild  
The Lamb and Flag, and Raoul's Bar  
  or go to Freud's, go near, go far.  
  
Its the Head of the River,  
  Its the Goose at the Green,  
Its the Wheatsheaf, the Trout Inn,  
  the Jude where I've been.  
  
The Grapes, Half a Moon,  
  The Gardener's Arms,  
The Magdalen, The Mitre,  
  the bottle at the farm.  
  
The Old Black Horse,  
  The Next Door Bar,  
St. Aldate's Tavern,  
  go near, go far.  
  
Yates's (which is closed)  
  The White House, The Turl,  
Three Goats Heads with Rosie O'Gradys,  
  that's my worl'  
  
-- cheers. hic!
