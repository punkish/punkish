Puneet Kishor. 1991. "Measuring Real Benefits of GIS/LIS in Wisconsin," *Geo Info Systems*, April 1991. 

Cooperation among organizations and agencies and a long-term commitment from decision makers to develop and maintain data bases is essential to the viability of a geographic and land information system (GIS/LIS). Cooperation and commitment, in turn, are fostered by an appreciation of the full range of benefits the technology produces. This article presents a method for measuring GIS/LIS benefits that was used in a multiagency natural resources project in Dane County, Wisconsin.
