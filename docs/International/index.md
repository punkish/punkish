Apparently I am in the wrong city because, per Linley Hamilton, “Belfast’s where it’s at man!” You wouldn‘t know though, in the hole-in-the-ground International Bar. The space is smaller than my bedroom, and Linley’s very international quintet fills it with sound. If music were second-hand smoke, I would be dead.
