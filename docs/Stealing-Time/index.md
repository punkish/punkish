Of you who has walked on this path before<br>
With rays of sun on dappled blades of grass<br>
I cannot ask but I must ask for more<br>
Lest flashes of life in a flash do pass<br>
<br>
Round as welkin orbs that hang are round<br>
By force they spin an endless cosmic dance<br>
Where squares are none for squares are seldom found<br>
And edges fade and blur in prose askance<br>
<br>
Two steps we march in step and find a cause<br>
For fate has played its hand in full conceit<br>
To make what one will be from what once was<br>
Like lines that are aligned but never meet<br>
<br>
So hold my hand and live this life sublime<br>
Ere time doth steal us let us steal the time<br>
<br>
