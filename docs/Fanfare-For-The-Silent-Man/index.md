## a day of noisy lives

a procession of half-crazed men  
lament in an ancient tongue  
three women clap in unison  
a soliloquy is sung  

an iron bus, blushing with  
its graceless rusty bod  
hurtles down a dusty road  
few patiently have trod  

driven by seemingly  
uncommon common sense  
carrying faithful pilgrims to  
a distant confluence  

to wash their sins, these precious drops  
of godly soma sweat  
will make them clean so they can once  
again go sin and yet  

come back again and wash their shame  
go sin another round  
nirvana yet from life and death  
circle vicious hound  

its muscles strain helplessly  
its head is bound to stone  
wooden wheels turn in the rut  
tiredly with its groan  

hags converse in a shrilly voice  
appetite is lost  
ears ring with the harpy’s wail  
the thoughts that it has cost  

a scorching wind’s invisible touch  
like a searing hand  
is drying up the parchment of  
a now historic land  

praises of this ancient land  
bards mystical sing  
a clamourous din of puritans  
a tinny, hollow ring  

that drowns the screams of a newly found  
freedom that’s abused  
inherit, live, bequeath a  
legacy of servitude  

maintenance, a worn facade  
a gash, a deeper line  
hides the smile, shrouds the brow  
a tangled, knitted skein  

empty minds with empty smiles  
take an empty stride  
lives that hocked their silence for  
an emptiness inside
