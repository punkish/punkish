I worked directly on projects that involved developing best practices for geographic information management, and strategic planning and information policy formulation. I was also called upon to write the technical and governance related components of project proposals.
            Developed strategic information plans, best management practices, enterprise GIS implementation plans, and plans for integration of GIS with emergency management and Enhanced 911 (E911).
            Developed web-enabled GIS and database applications, integrated disparate systems and application platforms using proprietary as well as open source programming languages, and RDBMS for State and County agencies.
            Developed new proposals for project work in geographic information and related technologies.
