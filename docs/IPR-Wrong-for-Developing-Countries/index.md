The [2007 Summer Fellows](http://www7.nationalacademies.org/policyfellows/Summer_2007_Bios.html) of the [Christine Mirzayan Science and Technology Policy Program](http://www.national-academies.org/policyfellows) organized a seminar titled **Intellectual Property Rights: Wrong for Developing Countries?**



![ipr]



The invited speakers were [John Wilbanks](http://sciencecommons.org/about/whoweare/wilbanks/), Executive Director of [Science Commons](http://www.sciencecommons.org) at [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org) and [Bruce Lehman](http://www.iipi.org/nav_about/boards.asp#Lehman), Chairman, [International Intellectual Property Institute](http://www.iipi.org/).



The seminar examined [Intellectual Property Rights] (IPR) and their implications for developing countries. Proponents argue that IPR promotes economic growth in developing countries by providing incentives for innovation. However, opponents contend that IPR discourages information sharing and collaborative innovation fundamental to balancing society's economic and social goals with the planet's environmental limits. By presenting pros and cons of IPR and their effect on information sharing, the seminar provided a lively debate on whether intellectual property rights are wrong for sustainable development in developing countries. 



Do IPR promote economic growth in developing countries? Do IPR promote sustainable environmental practices in developing countries? Do IPR promote better science and technology in developing countries? These and related issues were the topic of the seminar open to the public.
