On Mar 14, 2020, all of Spain went under an *Estado de Alarma,* a state of alarm in response to the rapidly spreading COVID19. For the next 48 days, we lived under one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. Yesterday, the process of easing the lockdown started. 

I went out for a walk to Puerta del Sol, the geographic and social heart of the city and made a little movie from the video clips I shot on the way. Below is “madrid – cuarenta y ocho días después,” with an incidental but happy nod to Danny Boyle’s zombie classic **28 Days Later**. Like that movie, this one too tries to convey that a combination of hope and optimism can win over the worst of it.
