* 2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter

* 1 cup chopped onion
* 1 large Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 2 teaspoons curry powder
* 1/2 cup dry Marsala
* 1 cup chicken stock or canned low salt chicken broth
* 2 teaspoons fish sauce
* 1 teaspoon Thai red curry paste
* 1 1/2 cups canned unsweetened coconut milk
* 1/2 pound penne pasta
* 1/2 pound crabmeat, flaked
* 3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium high heat. Add onion, apple and garlic; saut\xE9 until onion is soft, about 6 minutes. Stir in curry powder. Add Marsala. Boil until liquid is slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Add stock, fish sauce and curry paste. Simmer until liquid is slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add coconut milk. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until tender but still firm to bite. Drain well. Return pasta to pot.
