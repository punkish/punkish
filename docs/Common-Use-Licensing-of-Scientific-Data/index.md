A workshop titled **Common Use Licensing of Scientific Data** was jointly organized by [CODATA](http://www.codata.org/), the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](http://www.gbif.org/), and [Creative Commons/Science Commons](http://www.sciencecommons.org/). The workshop was held Sep. 23-24 in an 18th century room at [La Sorbonne](http://www.sorbonne.fr/) in Paris.

About 20 participants from academia, NGOs, and private consultancies, and caming from Asia (China, Japan, Taiwan), Africa (Uganda), Europe (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK), North American (USA), and South America (Brazil, Colombia, Peru) attended the workshop.

The charge of the workshop was to understand the uncertainties and lack of knowledge of the law in regards to licensing scientific data using Creative Commons licenses, and coming up with a plan to develop and promote a [Scientific Data License].
