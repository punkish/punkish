[PeerJ](http://peerj.com)

> If we can set a goal to sequence the Human Genome for $99, 
then why shouldn't we demand the same goal for the publication of research?

[eLife](http://elifescience.org)

[gvSIG](http://www.gvsig.com/en/products/gvsig-desktop)

> A powerful, user-friendly, interoperable GIS, designed to be an easily extensible solution, allowing thus continually improving the software application and developing tailor made solutions.

[GRASS](http://grass.itc.it/)

> GRASS GIS has raster, topological vector, image processing, volume voxel management/visualization, 2D/3D vector engine with vector network analysis and graphics production functionality that operates on various platforms through shell and a graphical user interface.

---

## Open Software (Backend)

[MapServer](http://mapserver.org)

> An Open Source platform for publishing spatial data and interactive mapping applications to the web.

[GeoServer](http://geoserver.org)

> GeoServer is an open source server for sharing geospatial data.

[Mapnik](http://mapnik.org)

> Mapnik is a Free Toolkit for developing mapping applications.

---

## Open Data…

[Global Change Master Directory](http://gcmd.nasa.gov)

[GEOSS Portal](http://www.geoportal.org/web/guest/geo_home_stp)

> The GEOSS Portal is your main entry point to Earth Observation data from all over the world.

[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/)

> OpenStreetMap is a map of the world, created by people like you and free to use under an open license.

---

## Open Data…

[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission](http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/)

> The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission collected topographic data in 2000 over nearly 80 percent of Earth's land surfaces, creating the first-ever near-global data set of land elevations.

[The National Map Viewer](http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/)

> Allows visualization and download of USGS's most current topographic base map data and products for free.

[National Water Information Service](http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/rt)

> Water-resources data collected at approximately 1.5 million sites in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

---

## Open Data…

[Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/)

> Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software.

[Earth-Base](http://earth-base.org)

> Our vision for earth-base is science- and data-focused. We think of earth-base as a tetrahedron linking the solid, fluid, living earths and the rock record. This illustrates the basic principle that motivates us: earth systems are interconnected, and there is no logical “center” that should dominate this effort.

---

## Open Data

[Comma Separated Values aka x,y](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt)

> A comma-separated values (CSV) (also sometimes called character-separated values) file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain-text form.

[Geodatabase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcGIS#Geodatabase)

> An object-relational database approach for storing spatial data. A geodatabase is a "container" for holding datasets, tying together the spatial features with attributes.
