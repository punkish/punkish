Sello Moeketsi channels the spirits of Hugh Masakela (“my main man”) and Abdullah Ibrahim (“my spiritual guide”), circles his breath, and blows into the gleaming Hawkes. A toddler looks up at Sello and places 50 cents on his leg… 

*summertime, and the livin' is easy*

A black man from Johannesburg to the corner of Winthrop and Oliver Plunkett is about as unlikely as sunshine in spring in Cork. A close-mouthed white guy sidles up and mutters through his barely open lips:

“How much is dat?” 

“About a thousand.” 

“You bot it?” 

I expect Sello to retort with, “No, I stole it!” But he calmly, sweetly says:

“Yah man, it’s my tool. I can make that much money in three gigs.” 

A red-head tosses a few coins in the open case… 

*the fish are jumpin', and the cotton is high*
