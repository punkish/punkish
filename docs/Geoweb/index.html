    <div class="content"><h2 id="intellectualpropertyissuesandgeographicdataintheinternetera">Intellectual Property Issues and Geographic Data in the Internet Era</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Law and the GeoWeb</strong>, a workshop on intellectual property (IP) issues and geographic data in the internet era. The workshop <a href="#organizers">organized jointly</a> by Creative Commons and United States Geological Survey, will be colocated with the <a href="http://www.aag.org/cs/annualmeeting">2011 Annual Meeting of the Association of American Geographers</a>, and will be held on <a href="#logistics">Monday, April 11, 2011 in Seattle, Washington</a> from 1 PM to 5 PM.</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>The United States Copyright Law protects original creative content for the benefit of the author or other rights holder. This raises many issues in today&#8217;s digital age because information is so easily created, shared, and copied. The law that protects creative content does not protect facts, that is, data that are discovered rather than invented. A complicating factor is that geographic data sets are typically made of discrete elements that may have been gathered over time and space by various agencies and individuals. While licensing datasets has become commonplace, it has created more confusion than solved. When different datasets or even different elements within a single dataset have different provenances, mixing them creates new datasets with further licensing conditions that are typically more restrictive.</p>
<p>With the advent of cheap computing and networking power available to everyone, the traditional roles of data producer and consumer are being turned on their heads. Collecting and managing large geographic datasets was formerly the domain of government agencies but today an increasing number of geographic datasets are being created, and shared by users outside government agencies. These datasets come with different expectations for reuse. This hodgepodge of licensing and contractual obligations creates a problem for data interoperability. For example, public agencies may be unable to mix licensed data with official government data due to stricter licensing terms for the resultant dataset. Thus, public agencies may be unable to capitalize on and benefit from user-generated content.</p>
<p>This workshop will focus on intellectual property issues with geographic data, exploring situations when users and creators who range from individuals to local, state, and federal agencies, private companies and non-profits create, share, and reuse geographic information from different sources in their projects.</p>
<h2 id="program">Program</h2>
<p>We have a lineup of <a href="#speakers">distinguished speakers</a> representing most major constituencies in the geographic data space &mdash; law/licenses, federal government, state governments, local governments, grassroots and citizen mapping, academia/research and policy, and private sector, we have covered it all.</p>
<p>The <a href="#agenda">format of the workshop</a> is designed to inform, provoke and encourage discussion. There will be three blocks of 10-15 minutes long presentations by two to three speakers in each block. Each block of presentation will be followed by a 30 minutes long discussion.</p>
<h3 id="agenda">Agenda</h3>
<p>The format of the workshop is designed to inform, provoke and encourage discussion. We will start with getting the non-governmental and policy perspective, and work our way via the corporate perspective to the concerns and viewpoints of state and federal governments.
