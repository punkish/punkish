## Maximization Of Vendor Profit



Every action by the vendor is designed to maximize profit. Such an approach inherently seeks the largest common denominator for functionality at the expense of specific needs. 



For example, if one client wants a specific need fulfilled, that would likely be very difficult to fulfill, or even impossible, as the vendor wouldn't respond to a single need. Additionally, the vendor wouldn't allow the client to make modifications to the licensed product as well. 



This is contrarian to the [Client Driven] approach that [Open Source] allows.
