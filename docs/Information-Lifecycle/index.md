The citizen who is the source of data and the collector of that data, interface at the five points, namely, Ⓐ, Ⓑ, Ⓒ, Ⓓ and Ⓔ as shown in the information lifecycle diagram below 

![info lifecycle](img/info-lifecycle.png)

**A**: Explore the potential of changing the conversation from the imperative of protecting privacy to the benefits of sharing. I call this [Citizens Consent](Citizens-Consent).

**B**: Demystify the terms of data collection, sharing, access, and reuse by simplifying terms of services (TOS), privacy and sharing policies.

**C**: Engage the citizens by involving them in the management and interpretation of the data sourced from them.

**D**: Change the way data are collected and packaged for redistribution and sharing.

**E**: Demystify the Data Use Agreements (DUA).
