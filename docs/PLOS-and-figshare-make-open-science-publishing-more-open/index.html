    <div class="description"></div>
    <div class="created">Tuesday, January 1, 1980</div>
    
    <div class="content"><p>PLOS and fig<strong>share</strong> <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2013/01/easier-access-to-plos-data/">announced</a> a <a href="http://figshare.com/blog/figshare_partners_with_Open_Access_mega_journal_publisher_PLOS/68">partnership</a> earlier today that will allow authors publishing in PLOS journals host their data on fig<strong>share</strong>. The authors would also benefit from the visualization capabilities that fig<strong>share</strong> provides right in the browser alongside the content. This partnership symbolizes all that is good about a healthy scientific publishing process that is enabled by innovative thinking aided by open licensing tools from Creative Commons.</p>
<p>When PLOS launched ten years ago, everyone involved could only hope for the kind of success it has seen in promoting open access publishing. Now with seven journals, six Currents sections, a network of blogs and new ways such as hubs and collections to organize content post-publication, PLOS spans a range of options from very selective to relatively inclusive. PLOS is the undisputed leader in the open access publishing space, and everything published by PLOS is under a CC license. But PLOS is constantly thinking of new ways to make the publishing process better.</p>
<p>John Chodacki, Director of Product Management at PLOS: “We know that Supporting Information acts as a container for valuable resources and data, but can remain relatively hidden from readers. With our partnership with fig<strong>share</strong> we are opening this data up to PLOS readers and showcasing its value.”</p>
<p>fig<strong>share</strong> is much younger. Founded by <a href="http://www.digital-science.com/people/mark-hahnel">Mark Hahnel</a>, a young scientist frustrated with the stunted mechanism for data sharing, fig<strong>share</strong> also adopted a blanket open licensing policy based on CC licenses and public domain dedication, and made it easy to upload, visualize and share data.</p>
<p>Mark says, “The common goal of PLOS and fig<strong>share</strong> for open access to research are connected by the liberal licensing of content, giving authors control over their outputs. Without the standards set out by Creative Commons, partnerships such as this would be much less achievable. Long may it continue as the academic space moves into new ways of disseminating research”.</p>
<p>Both PLOS and fig<strong>share</strong> leverage the internet to the fullest giving scientists a better way to publish research results and data. This directly promotes CC’s vision of <em>realizing the full potential of the Internet — universal access to research and education, full participation in culture — to drive a new era of development, growth, and productivity.</em></p>
<p>By complementing each other, PLOS and fig<strong>share</strong> help the entire scientific process take another step toward being truly open. They are shining examples of leveraging the open licensing and public domain dedication tools created by Creative Commons. We wish them continued success and a future full of innovations we hope will continue to surprise and delight us.</p></div>
