## Not All Freedoms Are Created Equal



Most every level in the computing stack can be modified by the user. **Except** for the commercially purchased application and data.



Vendors specifically restrict unauthorized modification, re-use, and redistribution of application and data. Not only the above is usually very prohibitive financially, it is prohibited, period.



This creates an onerous [Licensing Regime].



**Update:** Not anymore... seems like the [Hardware Layer] in the [Computing Stack] is under attack. Lexmark is putting small type on its ink cartridge boxes that prevent the buyer from exercising her free will.
