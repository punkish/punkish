MycoPrinter is an open source 3D bioprinter that prints mycelium substrate ready for inoculation with various types of fungi. It combines additive manufacturing with plant biological tissue to mimic living organisms sculpted into artistic shapes. As such, it aims to bring together engineering, biological sciences, and art together under the umbrella of open citizen science. The printer would allow printing relatively fine details that otherwise would be difficult to sculpt using regular mycelium growing techniques of mold-making. Any artist wanting to work with mycelium would be able to use the MycoPrinter.
