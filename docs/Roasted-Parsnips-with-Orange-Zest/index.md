 Adapted from David Pasternack of Esca

Time: 15 minutes

* 2 pounds parsnips, peeled and cut into large matchsticks 
* 1 tablespoon olive oil 
* 1 teaspoon salt 
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
* Juice of one orange
* Grated zest of one orange.

Heat oven to 500 degrees. Place parsnips in a large bowl; drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Turn parsnips into large roasting pan and roast, shaking pan occasionally, until golden, 10 to 15 minutes.

Remove from oven, add juice and zest, and toss to coat. Return to oven and roast until parsnips have caramelized, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to warm bowl and serve.

 Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
