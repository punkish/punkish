[A symposium and workshop](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/brdi/PGA_053371) were convened at the National Academies to bring together key stakeholders in the area of scientific knowledge discovery (SKD) for intensive and structured discussions in order to obtain a better understanding of the state-of-the-art and future trends in the study of computational SKD in the open online environment and to develop a range of options for future work in this area.
