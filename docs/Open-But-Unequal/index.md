This is not a scientific talk. It is a talk based on anecdotes and personal experience. I am an environmental scientist with a fair amount of experience in natural resources and earth science data analysis and management. I spent the last eight years of my life, the last three full time, advocating for open science, and as a consequence, immersed in copyright-related issues. For the past six months I have been independent, and a lot of my thoughts have focused based on this experience.

## Science is Primarily Institutional

When we are a part of an institution, we forget what it is like to be outside it.

Call it **Institutional Hegemony**.

???

I signed up for a workshop and wrote “independent” in the affiliation field, and was told that unless I provided a valid affiliation, I would be denied admission. Thankfully I was able to pull out my experience and background (with an organization) and the organizers backed off. But not everyone may be able to do that.

This sign was posted on the door of a makerspace that is housed in an institution. You have to be a member of the institution to access the space. But the language is harsh whereby a non-member is seen as a "problem."

Reputation system is self-selecting and rigged toward perpetuating silos.

The focus on &copy; reinforces the importance of publications over everything else. Science is a lot more than just its published results.
]

???

Science is a cyclical process, of reading the works of others, observing, hypothesizing, experimenting, analyzing and publishing one's own conclusions so the cycle may repeat. By focusing only on copyright, we are focusing only on one aspect of this process while understating the importance of the other. Our finite energies are sucked away trying to solve an artificial problem that is based on perceptions and beliefs rather than facts. And besides, we do little to change a way of working that at least passively and at worst actively excludes those who are not a part of the club.

Non-local physical gatherings are expensive.

The difficulties in getting travel visa makes it very difficult for scientists from developing countries to attend conferences held in developed countries

The legal framework is complicated, onerous and a waste-of-time for scientists

note: *someone should add up all the scientist-hours spent arguing about copyright and open access*

# So, what can we do?

---

## Open license is a start, not the end

* Add an open license to your work
* Use as liberal a license as possible, preferably CC0/PD
* Make your work available to others
* Make it easy for others to reuse it
* Engage with the community

---

## Engage with the community

* devise projects that engage citizens
* hold science cafés/pubs
* join a makerspace
* become a mentor
* help start a community makerspace
* (figure out how to) donate old equipment

---

## To Do

### channel funding to extra-institutional science

As is, funding is available only to those with an affiliation. Other than Kickstarter-type crowd funding mechanisms, citizen scientists have no way to acquire non-personal funds to support their inquiry.

---

## To Do

### work out the integration of extra-institution and traditional science

Integration of citizen/extra-institutional science with traditional science is an issue because the results of extra-institutional science are not published in a way that aligns with traditional science's record-keeping. No institutional repositories, DOIs, traditional review.
