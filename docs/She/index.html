    <h1 class="title">She</h1>
    <div class="description"></div>
    <div class="created">Wednesday, August 7, 1996</div>
    
    <div class="content"><p>She sips at morning tea<br />
She dresses up in fines<br />
She goes out once a month, when<br />
She customarily dines  </p>
<p>She dines in style at Caesar’s<br />
She swims to beat the heat<br />
She lounges at the club-side<br />
She walks the Brigade Beat  </p>
<p>She wears expensive dresses<br />
She looks so out of place<br />
She’s made up to be graceful, but<br />
She beats hell out of grace  </p>
<p>She moves the social circles<br />
She digs the latest groove<br />
She hums to Carly Simon<br />
She thinks it doth behoove  </p>
<p>She’s asked what, why, and whither<br />
She leads a digital life<br />
She answers yes, no, maybe<br />
She is a digital wife  </p>
<p>She’s happy he is happy<br />
She’s sad that she is sad<br />
She knows if she could shoot her shit<br />
She feels she would be glad  </p>
<p>She sits in her arena<br />
She tugs at greying hair<br />
She looks for clues in the mirror<br />
She sees she is not there  </p>
<p>She reaches for the kitten<br />
She traipses up the stairs<br />
She sees through all the ugly<br />
She knows that fair is fair  </p>
<p>She scrawls and draws on paper<br />
She writes her words in tongues<br />
She draws her breath in spasms<br />
She has problem with her lungs  </p>
<p>She forgets her own phone numbers<br />
She’s a forgetful dame<br />
She is thankful mercifully<br />
She does not forget her name  </p>
<p>She calls up the phone number<br />
She was given by a friend<br />
She is exasperated<br />
She hangs on till the end  </p>
<p>She rings up thirty times<br />
She waits for thirty rings<br />
She manages to convey<br />
She’s not happy with the things  </p>
<p>She is frantic when I’m tardy<br />
She is worried when I’m late<br />
She rides a roller coaster<br />
She is in a nervous state  </p>
<p>She drives a little crazy<br />
She drives a little car<br />
She’s lucky, (so are others)<br />
She doesn’t drive too far  </p>
<p>She fights with her beloved<br />
She fights with the other too<br />
She sometimes fights with both of them<br />
She doesn’t know who is who  </p>
<p>She deals with different mothers<br />
She faces different strife<br />
She thinks indifference will make<br />
She says, difference to her life  </p>
<p>She cooks, she says, she’s learned to<br />
She hates to be compared<br />
She’s pitched against such standards<br />
She says, that beg to be dared  </p>
<p>She asks for my assistance<br />
She wants me to pull along<br />
She does not realize that<br />
She herself is strong  </p>
<p>She has a certain something<br />
She’s good at things like that<br />
She is a born survivor<br />
She is like an alley cat  </p>
<p>She eats at corner cafés<br />
She drinks her tea from a plate<br />
She talks to wayward children<br />
She calls a stranger “mate”  </p>
<p>She chases chubby piglets<br />
She touches gnarly trees<br />
She proclaims them to be Ficus<br />
She whistles like the bees  </p>
<p>She sweats and stains her apron<br />
She marks her pants with tint<br />
She thinks it is ironic that<br />
She gives a sexual hint  </p>
<p>She is blessed, she is gifted<br />
She is twangy, she is thing!<br />
She is skinny, she is loaded<br />
She is wiry, she can sing  </p>
<p>She’s the joy of my giving<br />
She’s the reason of my life<br />
She laughs when I thank our stars that<br />
She is not my wife  </p></div>
