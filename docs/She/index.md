She sips at morning tea  
She dresses up in fines  
She goes out once a month, when  
She customarily dines  

She dines in style at Caesar’s  
She swims to beat the heat  
She lounges at the club-side  
She walks the Brigade Beat  

She wears expensive dresses  
She looks so out of place  
She’s made up to be graceful, but  
She beats hell out of grace  

She moves the social circles  
She digs the latest groove  
She hums to Carly Simon  
She thinks it doth behoove  

She’s asked what, why, and whither  
She leads a digital life  
She answers yes, no, maybe  
She is a digital wife  

She’s happy he is happy  
She’s sad that she is sad  
She knows if she could shoot her shit  
She feels she would be glad  

She sits in her arena  
She tugs at greying hair  
She looks for clues in the mirror  
She sees she is not there  

She reaches for the kitten  
She traipses up the stairs  
She sees through all the ugly  
She knows that fair is fair  

She scrawls and draws on paper  
She writes her words in tongues  
She draws her breath in spasms  
She has problem with her lungs  

She forgets her own phone numbers  
She’s a forgetful dame  
She is thankful mercifully  
She does not forget her name  

She calls up the phone number  
She was given by a friend  
She is exasperated  
She hangs on till the end  

She rings up thirty times  
She waits for thirty rings  
She manages to convey  
She’s not happy with the things  

She is frantic when I’m tardy  
She is worried when I’m late  
She rides a roller coaster  
She is in a nervous state  

She drives a little crazy  
She drives a little car  
She’s lucky, (so are others)  
She doesn’t drive too far  

She fights with her beloved  
She fights with the other too  
She sometimes fights with both of them  
She doesn’t know who is who  

She deals with different mothers  
She faces different strife  
She thinks indifference will make  
She says, difference to her life  

She cooks, she says, she’s learned to  
She hates to be compared  
She’s pitched against such standards  
She says, that beg to be dared  

She asks for my assistance  
She wants me to pull along  
She does not realize that  
She herself is strong  

She has a certain something  
She’s good at things like that  
She is a born survivor  
She is like an alley cat  

She eats at corner cafés  
She drinks her tea from a plate  
She talks to wayward children  
She calls a stranger “mate”  

She chases chubby piglets  
She touches gnarly trees  
She proclaims them to be Ficus  
She whistles like the bees  

She sweats and stains her apron  
She marks her pants with tint  
She thinks it is ironic that  
She gives a sexual hint  

She is blessed, she is gifted  
She is twangy, she is thing!  
She is skinny, she is loaded  
She is wiry, she can sing  

She’s the joy of my giving  
She’s the reason of my life  
She laughs when I thank our stars that  
She is not my wife
