Adapted from Bobby Flay, Bolo and Mesa Grill
 
Time: 45 minutes

* 5 pounds (about 10 medium or 5 large) sweet potatoes, scrubbed 
* 1/3 to 1/2 cup maple syrup 
* 3/8 cup créme fraiche 
* 4 teaspoons purée from canned chipotles 
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
* Salt to taste.
 
1. Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place potatoes on large baking sheet, bake until soft, 35 to 40 minutes for medium potatoes, up to 1 hour for large.
 
2. Meanwhile, combine syrup, créme fraiche, chipotle purée, cinnamon and salt in a small bowl. Whisk until smooth.
 
3. When potatoes are tender, remove from oven, slice in two lengthwise. Scoop hot flesh into a potato ricer or food mill, purée into bowl with other ingredients. Stir with rubber spatula to combine. Potatoes should be light and fluffy. Taste for seasoning, transfer to warm serving bowl, serve immediately.
 
Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
