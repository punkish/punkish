Adapted from Charlie Trotter of Charlie Trotter's, Chicago

* 4 medium sweet potatoes or yams, peeled and in large dice (4 cups)
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 2 tablespoons chopped sage leaves
* Salt and pepper
* 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil
* 1 pound mixed mushrooms (shiitake, portobello or cremini), cleaned, stemmed and in large dice (4 cups)
* 1 small red onion, finely chopped (1 cup)	
* 2 sprigs thyme, plus 1 tablespoon minced thyme
* 5 tablespoons butter
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten
* 1 to 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
* 2 to 3 cups vegetable broth
* 8 cups day old sourdough bread, in large dice (one 2 pound round loaf, trimmed of crust)
* 1 tablespoon rosemary, chopped fine
* 2 tablespoons chopped parsley.


Adjust oven rack to middle position, and heat oven to 350 degrees. In a roasting pan, place sweet potatoes, olive oil and 1 tablespoon sage leaves, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and toss to combine. Roast until golden brown and tender, tossing occasionally, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven, and set aside.

In a large skillet, heat grapeseed oil over medium-high heat. Saut√© mushrooms and red onions with thyme sprigs, stirring frequently, until mushrooms are caramelized, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat, stir 4 tablespoons butter into hot mushrooms, and discard thyme. Set mushrooms aside.

Use remaining butter to coat a 3 quart baking dish. In a large mixing bowl, whisk eggs, 1 cup cream and 2 cups chicken broth together. Add bread, and stir until coated evenly. Fold in sweet potatoes, mushroom mixture and remaining herbs. If bread cubes seem dry, add more cream and chicken broth. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon stuffing into baking dish, and bake until golden brown and cooked through, about 45 minutes.
