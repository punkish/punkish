The World Wide Web has become the world's largest networked information resource, but references to geographical locations remain unstructured and typically implicit in nature. This lack of explicit spatial knowledge within the Web makes it difficult to service user needs for location-specific information. At present, spatial knowledge is hidden in many small information fragments such as addresses on Web pages, annotated photos with GPS co- ordinates, geographic mapping applications, and geotags in user- generated content. Several emerging formats that primarily or secondarily include location metadata, like GeoRSS, KML, and microformats, aim to improve this state of affairs. However, the question remains how to extract, index, mine, find, view, mashup, and exploit Web content using its location semantics. This workshop brings together researchers from academia and industry labs to discuss and present the latest results and trends in all facets of the relationships between location concepts and Web information. <a href="/data/1/1S/1ST/1st_International_Workshop_on_Location_and_the_Web,_WWW_2008,_Beijing,_China/WWW_'08_2008_Location_and_the_web.pdf">download proceedings</a>
