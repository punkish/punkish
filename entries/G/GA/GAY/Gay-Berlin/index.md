![Gay Berlin](gay_berlin.mp4)

One of the most poignant memorials of the persecution of some just because of what they were is more a reminder that we are really how we treat others. Berlin's attempt to not forget the wrongs so that they may not be repeated is best symbolized, in my view, by this memorial to the persecuted homosexuals during the Nazi regime.
