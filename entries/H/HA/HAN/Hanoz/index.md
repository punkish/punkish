￼![Hanoz Shīsha-Garān](hanoz-couplet.png)

ज़ी वहम बर सर-ए-मीना खुद श’ह मी लरज़ी  
हनोज़ शीश’ह गराँ दर शिकस्तन संग अन्द  
– मीर्ज़ा अब्द-अल-क़ादिर “बेदिल”  

Why are you trembling, out of delusion, on account of your heart?  
The glass-blowers are the ones who created it, and they are still the only ones with the authority to break it.  
– Mirza Abd-al-Qadir “Bedil”

My dad, Dr. Kesri Kishor, was a teacher, a professor of pharmacology at King George’s Medical College in Lucknow, India. He was also an Urdu poet inspired by the Indo-Persian poetry tradition, in particular by [Mirza Abd-al-Qadir “Bedil”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul-Qādir_Bedil), a 17th Century Indian poet of Uzbek ancestry. A collection of my dad’s poems was published in 1978, but since the poems are written in Urdu, a script I cannot read, I did not fully comprehend the content and quality of these poems. Thankfully, my mom hand wrote the poems in Hindi, so I am able to read them and even transliterate them.

Since I didn’t understand the meaning of the couplet that inspired the title of the book, I turned [Hajnalka Kovács](<a href="https://sas.fas.harvard.edu/people/catherine-warner" target="_blank">)[^1], a scholar of “Bedil” at the University of Chicago, who very kindly translated the above couplet.

Now, 34 years after the book was published, I have made available the [entire content of the book, along with Hindi transliteration of the poems where available](/Hanoz?book). This is a long-term project, and as I, with the help of a few dear friends, am able to transliterate more poems, I will add them to the web site.
