<p class="u-cf">Yim Tin Tsai Fish Culture Zone red tide data measured in June 2018 by real-time water quality monitoring system of the Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD). Data provided by AFCD.</p>

**Note:** The readings are recorded at 10 min intervals. While that may be fine for real life, it is too long a time period to do any meaningful visualization over short periods. So we divide the emissionPeriod by the timerAdjustment to get a fake but more visualizable emissionPeriod. A timerAdjustment of 1 will keep the emissionPeriod to 10 mins. A timerAdjustment of 2 will halve the emissionPeriod to 5 mins, and so on. A default timerAdjusment of 60 is being used in the example above which sets the emissionPeriod to 10 seconds.
