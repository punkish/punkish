"I will get to it eventually."

**Eventually** is a market signal. It indicates that the task in question is less than most preferable at any given moment. It results in the task never being done. To say that "I will get to *it* eventually" sends a clear signal that there are tasks more important than *it*.

**Eventually** is now, for some changes are [immutable](I-hardly-knew-you-eh).
