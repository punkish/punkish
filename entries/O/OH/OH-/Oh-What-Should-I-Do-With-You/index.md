In a big bustling city a printmaker cried  
*Oh! what should I do with you*  

A new print she had made, and she could not decide  
*Oh! what should I do with you*  

When asked if she'd frame it, she immediately replied  
*Oh! what should I do with you*  

She didn't want to lose it, but she didn't want it tied  
*Oh! what should I do with you*  

after years of hard work, the joy and the pain  
the award, the book, some loss and some gain  
if you listen hard you can hear her say this again  
*Oh! what should I do with you*

The vagabond walked and was caught in mid-stride  
*Oh! what should I do with you*  

She painted a path so he could walk by her side  
*Oh! what should I do with you*  

His own expectations getting ever so wide  
*Oh! what should I do with you*  

Even a touch of eraser just could not hide  
*Oh! what should I do with you*  

This widening patch could leave a big stain  
give rise to eddies that could drown out the main  
all his wanderings then would be in vain  
*Oh! what should I do with you*  

----

Now if you think of the urges that cannot be denied  
*Oh! what should I do with you*  

A new print that she made on the stone deep inside  
*Oh! what should I do with you*  

Without asking you were engulfed in the tide  
*Oh! what should I do with you*  

Isn't it enough to be satisfied?  
*Oh! what should I do with you*  

stunning moments would ride over boredom and pain  
a brilliant stroke that would cut through mundane  
and you wouldn't ever have to sing this refrain  
*Oh! what should I do with you*
