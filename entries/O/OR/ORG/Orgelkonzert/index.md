![Orgelkonzert](orgelkonzert.mp4)

[Marktkirche](http://marktkirche-hannover.de), the 800 years old church in old Hannover had an organ concert scheduled, to be played on a 19th century Italian organ. The entrance was â‚¬5. Soon as my meeting got over, I was there. The program included Girolamo Frescobaldi, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Josef Gabriel Rheinberger. I didn't understand the music, but you don't have to understand music to enjoy it. That is why it is called music.
