<h2>Science <span class="punkish-dim">Benefits</h2>

### Economical

<p class="punkish-dim">Soon as you reuse the same content in a different project, you've doubled the return on investment. Effectively, the cost of developing any content is halved per project. Reuse it in more projects, and its cost per project goes down even further.</p>

### Serendipitous

<p class="punkish-dim">Find connections without looking for them. This is specially true in text mining cross-disciplinary archives.</p>

### Interdisciplinary

<p class="punkish-dim">Discover interconnections and influences between disciplines.</p>

---

<h2>Science <span class="punkish-dim">Benefits</h2>

### Reproducible and Verifiable

[Dan Gezelter](http://gezelterlab.org) writing in [Open Science](http://openscience.org/being-scientific-fasifiability-verifiability-empirical-tests-and-reproducibility/):

<blockquote>
<p class="punkish-dim"><b>Reproducible by whom?</b> By independent scientists, working elsewhere, and on different equipment.</p>

<p class="punkish-dim"><b>Reproducible to what degree?</b> Depends on how closely an independent scientist can reproduce the controllable variables.</p>

<p class="punkish-dim"><b>Wouldn’t reproducibility be very expensive?</b> Good scientific experiments must be reproducible in both a conceptual and an operational sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Society <span class="punkish-dim">Benefits</h2>

### Transparent

<p class="punkish-dim"><a href="http://app.wheredoesmymoneygo.org" target="_blank">Where Does My Money Go</a>: Aims to promote transparency and citizen engagement through the analysis and visualisation of information about UK public spending.</p>

<h2>Society <span class="punkish-dim">Benefits</h2>

### Lower Cost Through Increased Efficiency

<p class="punkish-dim">Estimated benefits 6-7 times that of the cost of implementing more standardized, open standards and procedures via the EU INSPIRE Program. <cite>Craglia, M. (2009). Assessing the socio-economic impacts of SDIs.</cite></p>

### Lower Cost Through Self-Help

<p class="punkish-dim">If citizens can perform simple tasks via self-service web sites then the public agencies can devote scarce resources elsewhere.</p>

### Reverse Brain Drain

<p class="punkish-dim">An innovative public sector can become an attractive employer for the smart entrepreneurs, innovators and activists who would otherwise seek employment in the private sector or leave the country.</p>

---

<h2>Citizens <span class="punkish-dim">Benefits</h2>

### Innovative

<p class="punkish-dim">Open data and APIs can enable individual citizens to develop innovative solutions, applications, and businesses that not only add value to the economy but also provide new services.</p>

### Empowering

<p class="punkish-dim">Individual citizens can better their lives with more equitable access to services.</p>

### Safety

<p class="punkish-dim">Timely access to certain services such as transportation, health, and child-care can improve general health and safety, even mean the difference between life and death.</p>
