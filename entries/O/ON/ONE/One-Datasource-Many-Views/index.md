## A GIS Is Like A Database



* GIS does not store maps

* GIS stores information from which maps can be made

* maps are like views in a database \x96 one set of tables, many views

* examples of "views"

   * **scale** - change extent of "ground" shown on the map (larger the number => smaller the scale => more the area shown => less the detail)

   * **projection** - [map projections](http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/mapproj/mapproj_f.html) represent spherical shapes on flat surface (Mercator, Albers, Lambert)

   * **isopleth** - represent continuous area data that varies smoothly over space (contours, isohyet, isotherm, isobar, isohume)

    **choropleth** - each spatial unit is filled with a uniform color or pattern (tax maps, density maps, land use)

* GIS allows [Spatial Analyses] of mappable data



GIS manages info that can be [Spatial or Non-Spatial]
