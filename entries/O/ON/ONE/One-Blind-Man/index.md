a blind man stands  
by the side of the grand  
showrooms in richman town  

tapping a tune  
with an aluminum spoon  
beating on concrete ground  

stoops for a drink  
that the poor man brings  
on a cart with only three wheels  

thinks of the stash  
from the rich man's trash  
that rounded his three square meals  

unseeing eyes  
gaze at passers by  
sweating cosmetic sheen  

expensive crease  
does the blind man tease  
with the look of faded blue jeans
