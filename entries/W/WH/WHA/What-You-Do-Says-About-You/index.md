[John Czaplewski](http://www.johnjcz.com/) aka [@johnjcz](https://twitter.com/johnjcz) texted me kvetching that someone had taken his work, work that John had put in the public domain via the [CC0 Public Domain Dedication](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), but this other person neglected to give John credit. Here is how our conversation went:


> ![John](john.png =72x72) [11:30:50 AM] John: i had one person (from &lt;nameless bad organization&gt;) that they use a module I wrote, but had to make a bunch of fixes - they haven't contributed them back<br><br>
> i just found some dude who took a different module I wrote, added two lines of code, and didn't cite me or contribute back<br><br clear="both">

> ![Puneet](punkish.png =72x72) [11:30:57 AM] punkish: he doesn't have to. That is why it is CC0<br><br clear="both">

> ![John](john.png =72x72) [11:31:01 AM] John: I know<br><br clear="both">

> ![Puneet](punkish.png =72x72) [11:31:09 AM] punkish: if you have expectations, then don't make your work CC0<br><br>
> use CC BY<br><br clear="both">

> ![John](john.png =72x72) [11:31:30 AM] John: I can't tell if I'm bothered or not<br><br clear="both">

> ![Puneet](punkish.png =72x72) [11:32:28 AM] punkish: but then you will spend a certain fraction of your life worrying about those expectations. On the other hand, if you are like me, you make something CC0 because you get joy in just making it and then moving on. Don't give a fuck about what others do. You've had your fun. Move on to the next bit of fun. I find that attitude has simplified my life by an unquantifiable fraction<br><br clear="both">

> ![John](john.png =72x72) [11:32:59 AM] John: I definitely lean toward CC0<br><br clear="both">

> ![Puneet](punkish.png =72x72) [11:33:09 AM] punkish: also, if you did make it CC BY, or even "All rights reserved," what is the guarantee they would credit you?<br><br>
the fact that they are not crediting you says more about them than about you<br><br clear="both">

> ![John](john.png =72x72) [11:33:21 AM] John: For me it's on the principle that I am paid by tax dollars<br><br clear="left">

> ![Puneet](punkish.png =72x72) [11:33:32 AM] punkish: the fact that you made your work CC0 says a lot about you<br><br>
> I am not paid by tax dollars but I just have little desire to own stuff, and definitely not on the basis of IP<br><br>
> actually, I am lying a bit. As of right now, I am indeed being paid by tax dollars, because the program that has hired me is funded by federal monies<br><br>
> but the principle remains the same<br><br clear="left">

> ![John](john.png =72x72) [11:34:52 AM] John: That's a good point<br><br>
> the chosen license says something, but the respect of it says more


John is a great guy, very smart programmer, sweet temperament, cat-lover, skinny-jeans-wearer, eats organic food, check-all-the-boxes. He has also used CC0 for most of his work almost ever since we have known each other. While I would like to think I may have something to do with that decision of his, he himself has everything to do with it. And therein lies a lesson:

कर्मणयेवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन  
मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते संगोस्तवाकर्मणि  

Chapter two verse 47 of भगवदगीता or [Bhagvadgita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita), or simply *Gita*, is “set in a narrative framework of a dialogue between *Pandava* prince Arjuna and his guide and charioteer Lord Krishna. Facing the duty as a warrior to fight the *Dharma Yudhha* or righteous war between *Pandavas* and *Kauravas*, Arjuna is counselled by Lord Krishna”[^1] to do his duty and not worry about the result.

*Karmanye Vadhikaraste, Ma phaleshou kada chana:* You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions  

*Ma Karma Phala Hetur Bhurmatey Sangostva Akarmani:* Never consider yourself the cause of the result of your actions, and may you never want to not do your duty
