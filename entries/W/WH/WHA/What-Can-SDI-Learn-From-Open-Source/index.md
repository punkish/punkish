notes      : I gave a presentation at the GSDI9 conference in [Santiago de Chile]. The disconnect between most of the folks who think SDI and open source was very apparent. I talked about the concept of a [Spatial Data Commons] based on the presentation on [Global Information Commons] by [Paul Uhlir]. The idea of a spatial data commons was received very well by the audience.

* Actually, quite a lot
* Including a few things it probably should not

---

= Basis For Assertion =
slidecontent: 
* Not just academic research but *hands-on* professional experience
* I write open source geospatial and database programs and applications and *get paid* for it
* Some of these programs solve very beastly computational problems that I am *unable* to solve with COTS proprietary software
* For my work, I depend upon an open source which is less like an *infrastructure* and more like a *commons*
slidehandout:

slide:
= Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) =
slidecontent: 
* National SDI: the technologies, policies, and people _necessary to promote sharing_ of geospatial data throughout all levels of government, the private and non-profit sectors, and the academic community &ndash; Federal Geographic Data Committee
* Global SDI: supports the establishment of _globally compatible_ local, national, and regional spatial data infrastructures, and supports interdisciplinary training, education and research activities that advance SDI development &ndash; Global SDI Committee

slide:
= Growth of Clearinghouses =
slidecontent: 
[notes: Crompvoets, Joep and Arnold Bregt. 2006. Worldwide Development Of National Spatial Data Clearinghouses (2000-2005)]
* Accompanied by a decline in *Suitability Index*
* These low values could be the consequence of the fact that the functional capabilities of clearinghouses do not fit expectations of the GI community, e.g. more *web services* and *user-friendly interfaces*

slide:
= Spatial Data Commons =
slidecontent: 
[notes: Uhlir, Paul. 2006. The Global Information Commons for Science Initiative and Its Relevance to Improved Access and Use of Geospatial Data]
* originating principally from *public sources*, made *freely available* for general use. Because &ndash;
** *legal* &ndash; (no legal incentives stemming from from exclusive property rights needed by the govt)
** *ethical* &ndash; (people have already paid for it)
** *political* &ndash; (transparency is undermined otherwise)
** *socioeconomic* &ndash; (greatly more impact if more users)

slide:
= SD Infrastructure to SD Commons =
slidecontent: 
[notes: Uhlir, Paul. 2006. The Global Information Commons for Science Initiative and Its Relevance to Improved Access and Use of Geospatial Data]
* The *commons* can enable the products made possible by the *infrastructure* to *reach the people*
* commons &ndash; made possible by the principles of *free and open source*
slidehandout:

slide:
= Free or Open Source? =
slidecontent: 
* Free as in *Freedom*
* Open Source as in uncompiled source
* Can't be Free *unless* Open Source
slidehandout:

slide:
= Free or Open Source? =
slidecontent: 
* Free &ndash; a matter of *right*
* Open Source &ndash; a matter of *practice*
* Free *and* Open Source &ndash; *right* to *practice* as you please
slidehandout:

slide:
= F/LOSS (or FLOSS) =
slidecontent: 
* Free/Libre Open *Source Software*
* Free/Libre Open *Data*
* Free/Libre Open *Information*
* Free/Libre Open *Applications*
* Free/Libre Open *Knowledge*

slide:
= Comparing Support =
slidecontent: 
* Proprietary
** Get a support contract
** Call a vendor
** Be put on hold or wait for callback
** Have a queued conversation
* FLOSS
** Subscribe to mailing list
** Ask a question
** Get an answer within a few minutes
slidehandout:

slide:
= Comparing Innovation =
slidecontent: 
* Proprietary
** Use the Vendor's toolbox
** Function within Vendor's limits
* FLOSS
** No limits of technology
** No limits of subject-matter
** Limited only by creativity
slidehandout:

slide:
= Comparing Cost =
slidecontent: 
* operating system/web server &ndash; proprietary: $200; FLOSS: $0
* database &ndash; proprietary: $50,000; FLOSS: $0
* spatial enabler for rdbms &ndash; proprietary: $7,500; FLOSS: $0
* desktop gis &ndash; proprietary: $1,500; FLOSS: $0
* web map server &ndash; proprietary: $5,000; FLOSS: $0
* programming language/IDE &ndash; proprietary: $500; FLOSS: $0
* support &ndash; proprietary: $5,000; FLOSS: $0
* Using FLOSS &ndash; Priceless
slidehandout:

slide:
= What FLOSS Is Not =
slidecontent: 
* Anti-commercial
* Necessarily free of monetary cost
* Against making money
* Socialist or Communist or Capitalist
slidehandout:

slide:
= What FLOSS Is =
slidecontent: 
* simply the freedom
** to do what you want
** with a tool or data that you may have already paid for
slidehandout:

slide:
= Importance of Open Standards =
slidecontent: 
* FLOSS was born from open standards
* FLOSS is not only *for* open standards, FLOSS *cannot exist without* open standards
slidehandout:

slide:
= Importance of Open Standards =
slidecontent: 
* Sharing only possible if there are at least three structural supports
** *legal* &ndash; clearly understandable licenses, agreements and commitment
** *cultural* &ndash; desire
** *technological* &ndash; open formats and fast and easy communications
slidehandout:

slide:
= Similarities Between GIS and FLOSS =
slidecontent: 
* FLOSS depends on sharing of ideas, techniques, data, and applications
* GIS practioners have promoted sharing as being essential to success
* Seems like a marriage made in heaven
* But, there are a few caveats
slidehandout:

slide:
= What GIS Shouldn't Learn From FLOSS =
slidecontent:
* A Babel of Licenses
** More than 90 different licenses, perhaps many more
** Each license with a different level of restriction
** Each license with a different level of contagious-ness
** Mechanisms such as *Creative Commons* licensing can help
slidehandout:

slide:
= What GIS Shouldn't Learn From FLOSS =
slidecontent: 
[notes: Resl, Richard]
* Social Networking Communities vs. Networking Social Communities
** Successful cyber communities have sprung from FLOSS
** Expecting the same from physical communities may be unrealistic
** But there are models out there, por ejemplo, the concept of *minga* as practiced by the Shuar Indians in Ecuador
slidehandout:

slide:
= What GIS Shouldn't Learn From FLOSS =
slidecontent: 
* Ease of Use
** not as easy as some of the desktop GIS software, but the gap is narrowing
slidehandout:

slide:
= What GIS Shouldn't Learn From FLOSS =
slidecontent: 
* Decisions are made around camp-fires, not around mouse and keyboard
** The kind of data managed by GIS inherently different from that managed by other collaborative computing efforts
** Land and its resources hold different value to communities than that held in Flickr or wikipedia
** Nevertheless...
slidehandout:

slide:
= A Few Examples =
slidecontent: 
* Made Possible by Open Standards and Open Source Technology and Data
# Example 1
# Example 2
