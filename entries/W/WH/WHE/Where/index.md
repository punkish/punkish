On April 5, 2015, I set out on Amtrak’s California Zephyr, crossing the country from San Francisco to Washington DC, with nothing but one 19” backpack. I had gotten rid of almost everything I owned (sold, gave away, or tossed), given up my rent-controlled lease on Leavenworth and Pacific, and set out on a new experiment—get out out of my comfort-zone, not have a permanent home, to live simply, to open myself to new experiences, places and people. This page keeps track of where in the world I’ve been, am, and will be.
