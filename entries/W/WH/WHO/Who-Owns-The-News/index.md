> I'm confused about who the news belongs to. I always have it in my head that if your name’s in the news, then the news should be paying you. Because it’s **your news** and they’re taking it and selling it as their product… If people didn’t give the news their news, and if everybody kept their news to themselves, the news wouldn’t have any news.

-- Andy Warhol, 1975
