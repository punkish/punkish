notes      : A lot of people talk of licensing data. That is usually not applicable (as data are not licensable, at least not on the basis of copyright), and it is also possibly misleading. There are just as much, if not more, important issues of integrity and ethics, in both gathering and sharing data that come into play, particularly if humans are involved (whether the humans are the ones gathering the data or humans are the subjects of the data gathering exercise).

## Approving conventional science projects

Traditionally done by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)

> (In the United States) IRBs must approve proposed non-exempt research before involvement of human subjects may begin.

## But what about…

# Citizen Science?

---

## Citizen Science

> Citizen science… is changing the relationship between science and society, helping meet environmental challenges by fostering more collaborative, interdisciplinary research.

Is Democratizing Research</a>

## But…

## How do we evaluate, approve and monitor (some) citizen science projects?

## Three kinds of open projects

  ### Contributory

.right-column[
Projects that are generally designed by scientists and for which members of the public primarily contribute data

## How do we approve non-conventional projects

- citizen science
- sensors
- self-measurement (quantified self)
- participant led research (PLR)

---

## Substitute for IRBs

# ? 

---

## What about ongoing monitoring?

### Collecting data on others
### (Mis-)Reporting Data
### Damaging Irreplaceable Evidence
### Invading Privacy of Others
### Balancing Privacy and Honesty
### Giving Credit

---

## Legal tools are…

### Inadequate
### Inappropriate
### Expensive
### Complicated
### Fear-driven

---

# Do no evil

## That hasn't gone down very well

---

# Respect and social contract

## Can good behavior and a sense of community work?

---

## Good behavior by another name

### Code of conduct
### Social contract
### Hippocratic oath
### Honor code
### Respect

---

## Importance of data integrity

### open is good but not a substitute for good science
### what if the design is open but the data are bad?

---
