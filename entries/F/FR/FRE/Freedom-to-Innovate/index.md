## "Freedom" Is The Key To Free Software

"Free software" is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of 

* "free" as in "free speech," 
* not as in "free beer."

Freedom to innovate, to add value, to adapt for one's specific needs - these are the freedoms that "free" software makes possible.

This concept can be applied to the entire [Computing Stack]().
