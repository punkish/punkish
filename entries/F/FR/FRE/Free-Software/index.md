## Definition of Free Software



Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it refers to four kinds of freedom, for the users of the software:



1. **freedom 0** - The freedom to run the program, for any purpose

1. **freedom 1** - The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

1. **freedom 2** - The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.

1. **freedom 3** - The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.



The above is from [The Free Software Definition](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).



Free software promotes the [Freedom to Innovate].
