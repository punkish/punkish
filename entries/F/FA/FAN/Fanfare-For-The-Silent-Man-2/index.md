## the beast master’s evening

subservient and supplicant  
obsequious at that  
to a master who is dangerous  
like a cornered rat  

onerous selves, served to sate  
they sacrifice a hen  
gather round with seven plates  
heads of seven men  

the belly of a pregnant sow  
a seediness that’s grim  
rants and raves and gorges on  
a momentary whim  

what will you do? when will you come?  
which one? for whom and how?  
who are you with? where have you been?  
why are you thinking now?  

so lashes out, screams a name  
rasping through the snout  
doubles up with pain of shame  
slinks and starts to pout  

a feeble *id* flows and fades  
and flows to fade once more  
as the tide that clings for life  
on a slippery shore  

waning like another tide  
a temporary lull  
shallow as the thoughts that float  
within the master’s skull  

ephemeral as the foam  
upon the waves recedes  
out-of-sight is out-of-mind  
such complacence it breeds  

looking in the wishing well  
a source of shallow strength  
turn the back for another piece  
of tripe of a quarter length  

“some offal please,” a piece of flesh  
oozing sticky fat  
“thanks for the gut, is it time yet  
to skin another cat?”  

who is to blame for the master’s shame  
a weakness there to see  
the slaves will stir from their slumber  
longing to be free  

grumbling from beneath the veil  
pray, condone their sins  
mercy from the screaming of  
a thousand violins  

[night may bring hope](Fanfare-For-The-Silent-Man-3)
