notes      : The good news is that the private sector is taking over from the public agencies when it comes to innovation and investment in the medical/health domains. As such, the difficult but crucial technological advancements, especially when it comes to balancing the desire for sharing with the need for privacy, are going to come from the private sector. The bad thing is that we are already witnessing unintended side-effects to this. And the ugly part is that there will be many more undesirable consequences in the future. The necessary checks and balances—consent, governance, and reparations from harm—will have to come from the public sector, that is, both the government and the common people.

## Governance Options

The party that collects data from me should explain to me:

- where that data will be kept and how will it be kept safe
- who will be able to access it
- what will be done with it 
- what are the risks
- what are the benefits to me and to society

--

If there are plans to use my data beyond what is or those who are described above, 

--

It should be explained to me that some data use may mean that if I change my mind, it may not be possible to stop others from using my data.

--

In any case, my identity should not be revealed to anyone other than a medical researcher who has committed to protecting my identity.

--

In case of a security breach, I will be made whole.

## Comparison with the GeoSpatial Domain

The same movement happened in the geospatial area 20+ years ago.

???

The geospatial domain was dominated by the government. Only governments were rich enough to own and launch satellites, carry out surveys, and air photography. Then the action shifted to the private sector. And finally, the individuals got empowered because of two reasons:

- the geographic space is interesting and important to all of us, esp. to the young (who tend to be computer savvy)
- data became freely available, so there was raw material to play with

A similar shift seems to be taking place in the health/medical domains, though delayed by about a couple of decades

--

exclude: true

<h2>The shift may be incomplete</h2>

<p>Qualitative differences between geo and health data</p>

???

However, the second shift, from private sector to individuals, as it happened in the geospatial world, is far from assured in the health/medical fields. Again, the lack of data because of security and privacy concerns, and a lack of interest in health for most people, especially the young and the computer savvy, are the stumbling blocks.

---

## Action moving from public to private sector

Private sector is making large investment in the medical/health domains

???

Because of expense, social nature of the task, and the associated privacy and security considerations, this sector has been the purview of governments, for the most part. But increasingly, private companies are investing heavily into health.
This is not unlike the geospatial domain, but is phase-delayed by about a couple of decades, and affected by a couple of important differences that might block similar progress. The good news is that the private sector is taking over, and as such, most of the badly needed investment and innovation, particularly when it comes to balancing the desire for sharing with the need for privacy, is going to come from the private sector.

--

<h2>Effect</h2>

<p>Unintended as well as intended but not widely-advertised side-effects</p>

???

The bad thing is that we are already witnessing unintended as well as intended but not widely-advertised side-effects to this. And the ugly part is that there will be many more undesirable consequences in the future. The necessary checks and balances—consent, governance, and reparations from harm—will have to come from the public sector in the widest to the narrowest sense, that is, from the government to the common people.

I don’t know who thinks things are going to get better, that somehow we’re just the one generation that is screwed. Funding lines are going to keep getting worse. Even in NIH grantwriting seminars, I’m getting told by people who sit on review panels that there is an increasingly high degree in subjectivity in who gets funded because once a grant is in the top 20%, how do you tell the difference between the top 10% and 20%? Poor reading, pettiness, cronyism – this is not what I’m hearing from sour grapes junior faculty, this is what I’m hearing from R01-funded faculty who sit on NIH review panels.

## Surveillance Capitalism

Four characteristics of business driven by computer-mediated transactions: 
- ‘data extraction and analysis,’ 
- ‘new contractual forms due to better monitoring,’ 
- ‘personalization and customization,’ and 
- ‘continuous experiments.’ 

This architecture produces a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power that Zuboff calls: ‘Big Other.’ It is constituted by unexpected and often illegible mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that effectively exile persons from their own behavior while producing new markets of behavioral prediction and modification. Surveillance capitalism challenges democratic norms and departs in key ways from the centuries-long evolution of market capitalism.

### Google DeepMind and healthcare in an age of algorithms

Julia Powles and Hal Hodson

> Data-driven tools and techniques, particularly machine learning methods that underpin artificial intelligence, offer promise in improving healthcare systems and services. One of the companies aspiring to pioneer these advances is DeepMind Technologies Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Google conglomerate, Alphabet Inc. In 2016, DeepMind announced its first major health project: a collaboration with the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, to assist in the management of acute kidney injury. Initially received with great enthusiasm, the collaboration has suffered from a lack of clarity and openness, with issues of privacy and power emerging as potent challenges as the project has unfolded. Taking the DeepMind-Royal Free case study as its pivot, this article draws a number of lessons on the transfer of population-derived datasets to large private prospectors, identifying critical questions for policy-makers, industry and individuals as healthcare moves into an algorithmic age.

April 4, 2017

Moorfields' scans will allow the Google subsidiary to improve the commercial viability of its systems, by improving the accuracy with which it can detect particular eye diseases -- potentially making a commercial version of the software a must-buy for the hospital. However, according to a freedom of information (FOI) request filed by ZDNet, there has been no deal agreed between the two organisations to roll-out the software once it's trained up, and DeepMind is only paying Moorfields for the staff time involved in processing the data before handing it on to the AI company.

17 June 2014

> The audit, led by former Terrence Higgins Trust chief executive Sir Nick Partridge, found that 3,059 data releases had taken place between 2005 and 2013 – with a detailed examination of 10% of these. It found "lapses in the strict arrangements that were supposed to be in place to ensure that people's personal data would never be used improperly". Of those examined in depth, it was found that one research programme had no legal authority to get patient-identifiable data but was still accessing NHS records in 2014. And a further eight were still getting mortality data – which could potentially pinpoint individual patients – without approval. In all nine cases medical researchers have suspended their work.

## Inspire

### Taking Matter Into Their Own Hands

<blockquote>
The idea for Inspire was born at a 2005 event sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry, in which Loew’s wife, an organic chemist, was employed. Several people at the event were in the research-and-development end of the drug business.

“These R&D companies with gigantic budgets described their biggest problem as recruiting patients for clinical trials,” he said. “Privacy in America makes it appropriately illegal to buy lists of patients.”

A lightbulb went off, he said: “What if you create a social network for patients and caregivers and allow them to raise their hands if they want to participate in clinical trials?”

### Taking Matter Into Their Own Hands

<blockquote>
“Patient centricity really matters,” said Loew, who owns a big chunk of the company, along with investors and employees.

Membership is free and increasing by 1,000 per day. Seventy-eight percent of members are women.

“Women are the chief medical officers of the home,” Loew said. “Many of our female members represent a member of the family — husbands, fathers, fathers-in-law, siblings, children. So sometimes a woman would join and say, ‘I’m a parent of a ‘preemie,’ a child of someone with a medical condition, a sister of someone else.’ ”

"The first pillar of the solidarity-based approach consists of making data use that is desirable from a public benefit point of view easier. The second pillar of the solidarity-based approach consists of enhancing harm mitigation instruments in cases where people are harmed as a result of their, or other people’s, data being used. The third pillar consists of introducing taxes for data uses that do not meet the criteria of ‘desirable use’"—Barbara Prainsack
