This is the portal to my India experience at Vidya. These are some of the things I am involved in --



* [Teaching Young Kids]

* [Teaching Adults]



*Monday July 18th*



Today I reached the IIT campus. IIT Mumbai is located in Powai,a region in Mumbai. The vast majority of Mumbai is known to be a bustling, overcrowded metropolis with life teeming from its every corner. This campus, however, is the beautiful exception. Surrounded by lush dark green trees, gardens, and a spectacular lake, IIT Mumbai is in a wonderful wilderness haven. "Watch out for the leapords!" My grandmother warned me before I set off to the campus. Actually, one of the world's few remaining leapord "sanctuaries" (?) lies in the forests surrounding Powai; rumors abound of leapords carrying away small children and household pets. To quell the leopard issue, the government had apparently introduced monkeys into the forest so as to provide an alternate food source for the leopards... 



Neverthless, I have arrived at the campus, not to study at the prestigious IIT college, but to volunteer for a month at an NGO called VIDYA. VIDYA is an organization commited to helping empower the underpriveleged women and children surrounding the IIT campus. I am going to write about my experiences in this blog, so that I may remember each detail of my sure to be wonderful stay here with VIDYA at the IIT campus.



*Wednesday July 20th*



Last night I wondered if the famous monsoons, that I had been so thoroughly warned about, had run away at the sight of me. This morning, however, as a polite gesture, the skies showered me with an intense welcome, leaving my entire Salwar Kameez outfit drenched. Of course, I had conveniently left my umbrella in my room - I'm sure the passersby were quite amused by the sight of a strange Indian-seeming girl scrambling through the streets clamping her bag over her head. 





*Friday July 22nd*



I love interacting with these children. For a few hours daily, I go to a classroom and help teach these students conversational English and grammar. The students learn English at their school, but due to external circumstances, they are unable to cope with the learning and receive extra help from VIDYA in the form of Remedial classes. These Remedial classes are offered for English, Math, and Sciences, which are conducted through English, Marathi, or Hindi-medium.
