Commitment is so much like investing, a strategy that involves taking risk by binding oneself to a cause or a person, with hope for less than certain but hopefully positive returns in the future. The unemotional part comes from being ready to change one’s strategy when the returns from sticking to it are evaluated to be less than the returns from changing course. 

(the above is a stub of a work in progress)

Of course, commitment is a vague word unless one also considers to what one is committing. As Vesper Lynd says in Casino Royale, “There are dinner jackets and then there are dinner jackets; this is the latter.”
