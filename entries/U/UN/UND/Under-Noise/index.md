> Under_Noise is a series of installations by [Franciska Rocha Gon√ßalves](https://franciscagoncalves.com) exploring different types of vibro-acoustic disturbances. The first work is *Luciferina*, where the exploration of sound disturbance aims to be a metaphor for the threat marine organisms may face nowadays. The data collected from underwater recordings are used as input for revealing sound frequencies and light scattering relationships, exploring concepts such as aurality, presence, immersion, or synesthetic perception. This artwork creates an immersive environment through a dialogue between sound and light, exposed by vibrational phenomena, where low frequencies disturb light visualization. The input data from underwater recordings have a particular emphasis on motor vessels and propellers sounds.
