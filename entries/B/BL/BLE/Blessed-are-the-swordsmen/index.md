Blessed are the fear-mongers who saw evil in everything fun  
Blessed are the fun-makers who showed us how evil is done  

Blessed are the reported-on with their retweeted moral outrage  
Blessed are the reporters who sacrificed truth for being first on page  

Blessed are the faithful who sought confirmation in grief  
Blessed are the faithless who couldn’t believe their belief  

Blessed are the homeowners paying a bigger than usual price  
Blessed are their bankers who got bailed and profited twice  

Blessed are the friendships that were shallower than desert loam  
Blessed are the strangers who opened their arms and homes  

Blessed are the wanderers who seek a place of their own  
Blessed are those with their own places and yet bear them like stone  

Blessed are the stone-faced who hide each pain they grieve  
Blessed are the romantics who pin their hearts on their sleeve  

Blessed are the artists wielding brushes as sword  
Blessed are the swordsmen whose pens strike a mightier chord  

Blessed is the last year as close to gloom it could get  
This next year is also blessed for it’ll be a doozy yet
