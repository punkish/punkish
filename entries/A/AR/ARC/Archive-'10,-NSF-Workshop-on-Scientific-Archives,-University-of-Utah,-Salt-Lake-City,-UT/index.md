[Archive '10](http://users.emulab.net/trac/archive10/), the NSF Workshop on Archiving Experiments to Raise Scientific Standards was held May 25-26, 2010, on the University of Utah campus in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.

The workshop focused on the creation of archives of computer-based experiments: capturing and publishing entire experiments that are fully encapsulated, ready for immediate replay, and open to inspection. It brought  together a few areas of the scientific community that represent fairly advanced infrastructure for archiving experiments and data (physicists and biomedical researchers) with two areas of the computer systems community for which significant progress is still needed (networks and compilers). The workshop  also included experts in enabling technologies and publishing.

[My position paper](http://users.emulab.net/trac/archive10/attachment/wiki/PositionPapers/kishor-position_paper.pdf) was titled **Interoperability as a guiding principle for long-term archives**

**Abstract:** The only reason we store something in an archive is so we can take it out again. And once we take it out, more likely than not, we want to do something with it, usually by mixing it with other data. The ease with which that can be done is termed "interoperability." By removing expectations and obligations from the use of our data, we remove all barriers to their use. Reciprocally, having free data available to us enables us to continue in our scientific quest unhindered and unfettered by legal hurdles. CC0, a new protocol launched by Creative Commons, helps converge scientific data toward the public domain.
