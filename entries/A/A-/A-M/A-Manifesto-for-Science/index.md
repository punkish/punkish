Value *v* of any work is the sum of many kinds of values: monetary, social, cultural, strategic, etc. Value *V* of a dataset is the sum of the value of each work in the dataset: <code>V = v<sub>1</sub> + v<sub>2</sub> … v<sub>n</sub></code> [more](It-Takes-All-Kinds-to-Make-a-Commons)

Creative Commons, in spite of its reluctance toward non-copyright focused projects, has undertaken a few novel experiments. [more](Beyond-Law)

## Learning by Making, Teaching by Doing

The hacker/maker movement embodied in hacker/maker spaces is the best convergence of the new old form of learning by making and teaching by doing. [more](Learning-by-Making)
