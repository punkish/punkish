So, you install some highly nerdy super secure app after typing 13 commands in the console, doing `apt get bullshit` seven times, commenting a few #ifdef in a .c file and recompiling (but first you had to install `cmake`). The app lets you send only 13 characters at a time, no copy and paste, and certainly no Unicode. You feel like a king, you are on the top of the world. You even update your Twitter bio: *Son, boyfriend, brother, Christian, geek, likes bread, him/his. Signal user.*

Then the cute thing sitting next to you asks if you can share "your WhatsApp" so you two can message each other after the French verb conjugation class. Fissssss… that is the sound of the air going out of your ego. At that point you would happily pay someone a ¼ bitcoin to wake you up from the nightmare.
