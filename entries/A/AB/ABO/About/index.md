<h2>Itinerant Open Science and Data Advocate</h2>

<p>I am a science researcher and an open access advocate, an engineer and an environmental scientist with expertise in both ‘science for policy’ as well as ‘policy for science.’. I travel to wherever my experience and skills can help make a system, an organization, or a community more open.</p>

<p>Since 1985 my career has spanned rural appropriate technology design to international development, academia, research and science information policy. Other than one stint with a small for-profit company, all my work has been with non-profit organizations. I am currently an independent consultant with <a href="http://worldbank.org" target="blank">The World Bank</a> and <a href="http://academyhealth.org" target="blank">Academy Health</a>. I am also a member of <a href="http://plazi.org" target="blank">Plazi</a>, and just finished an appointment at the <a href="http://www.geoscience.wisc.edu" target="blank">Department of GeoScience, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA</a> where I was working on a machine reading and learning system built on a new kind of digital library resource. Before that I was the Manager of Science and Data Policy at <a href="http://creativecommons.org" target="blank">Creative Commons</a> where I focused on open data, text and data mining, open science policy, and citizen-sourced information. I am also a member of the <a href="http://rd-alliance.org" target="blank">Research Data Alliance Interest Group on Legal Interoperability of Research Data</a>, <a href="http://www.codata.org/task-groups/data-citation-standards-and-practices" target="blank">CODATA Task Group on Data Citation Standards and Practices</a>, and I co-authored the chapter on <b>Emerging Principles for Data Citation</b> in the Task Group’s report titled <i>Out of Cite, Out of Mind.</i></p>

<p>My interests are in open sensor-based hardware, ethical issues around citizen-sourced information, licensing open hardware and certification of data quality, novel ways of citizen-engagement, and promoting hacker/maker spaces for learning-by-making, teaching-by-doing. I believe that not only is it possible to be both a practitioner and a policy-person at the same time, in today’s day and age it is the only way to ensure that our work has the highest possibility of making an impact, be it uncovering new knowledge or solving an intractable problem from local to global scales.</p>

<p>I help domain scientists make sense of data by adopting, adapting and creating novel data acquisition, analysis and access techniques. And I work on the policies to create an environment where information is <b>open by default.</b> I serve as an advisor on various scientific projects, and advocate for a more participatory, collaborative way of working in a world where information and analytics are embedded in every aspect of our lives.</p>
