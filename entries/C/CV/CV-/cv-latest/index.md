                <p>Since 1985, my career has spanned rural appropriate technology design, international development, academia, research, and science information policy. I help domain scientists make sense of their data by adopting, adapting and creating novel data acquisition, analysis and visualization techniques. I advise several scientific projects, and advocate for a more participatory way of working in a world where information and analytics are embedded in every aspect of our lives. As such, I have expertise in both ‘science for policy’ as well as ‘policy for science.’ I believe that not only is it possible to be both a practitioner and a policy-person at the same time, in today’s day and age it is the only way to ensure that publicly funded scientific information is open by default and our work has the highest possibility of making an impact.</p>

The setting was exactly like the hardware labs from my undergraduate engineering days, and Peter was there exactly like one of my buddies showing kits and circuits cobbled together to do science (except, Peter is quieter and more polite than most of my buddies). Peter founded ManyLabs, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that wants:
                <blockquote>students of any age to become comfortable with data, scientific processes, and mathematical representations of the world. We want people to learn about the strengths and limitations of using math and data to address real-world problems.</blockquote> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/39283" target="_blank">more</a></p>

            <div class="cv-job">2013. Frank Warmerdam–Leading Open Geospatial Community By Action, Creative Commons, Aug 7, 2013
                <p class="cv-summary">What do you get when you write software that becomes the basis of just about every geospatial application out there? You get perspective. Frank Warmerdam has been authoring, improving, supporting, and shepherding Shapelib, libtiff, GDAL and OGR for the past 15 years. Frank believes that by sharing effort, by adopting open, cooperatively developed standards, and avoiding proprietary licenses, adoption of open technologies could be supercharged. And lucky for us, he is right. To paraphrase him, open standards facilitate communication, capture common practice, and externalize arbitrary decisions. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/39271" target="_blank">more</a></p>

                <p class="cv-summary">About 400 map makers, coders, cartographers, designers, business services providers and data mungers of chiefly spatial persuasion gathered in San Francisco to “talk OpenStreetMap, learn from each other, and move the project forward.” These conference attendees are a tip of an iceberg composed of 1.1 million registered users who have collectively gathered 3.2 billion GPS points around the world since OpenStreetMap was launched in 2004 as a free, editable map of the whole world. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/38514" target="_blank">more</a></p>

                <p class="cv-summary">Interoperability has become a much bandied around concept of late, but with good reason. As science becomes more expansive in scope, using large data sets from several sources and disciplines, to study long term problems that span many populations, geographies, jurisdictions and periods, interoperability becomes increasingly important. <a href="http://punkish.org/Financial-Interoperability" target="_blank">more</a></p>

                <p class="cv-summary">Hanging around with our own kind, we in the open science community might get lulled into thinking that everyone out there thinks like us. In reality, most scientists actually do science instead of worrying about whether or not it is open. However, even though some of their practices align with open science objectives, there is much more that can be done proactively to engender an open commons of science. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/37146" target="_blank">more</a></p>

                <p class="cv-summary">There are many ways we can measure the effect of the work we do — count the number of objects licensed with CC licenses, count the number of users who have used CC licenses, count the number of works created by reuse of works licensed with CC licenses, perhaps many other ways. But the one that is most immediately visible, and most satisfying, is seeing events of spontaneous openness appear as is for the international celebration of Open Data Day taking place tomorrow, February 23. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/36868" target="_blank">more</a></p>

                <p class="cv-summary">PLOS and figshare announced a partnership earlier today that will allow authors publishing in PLOS journals host their data on figshare. The authors would also benefit from the visualization capabilities that figshare provides right in the browser alongside the content. This partnership symbolizes all that is good about a healthy scientific publishing process that is enabled by innovative thinking aided by open licensing tools from Creative Commons. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/36504" target="_blank">more</a></p>

                <p class="cv-summary">Creative Commons has formed a new Science Advisory Board (SAB) to guide its science program and to provide overall strategic vision and focus. The SAB brings legal, institutional as well as domain-specific knowledge in the use and sharing of scientific tools and data. Our SAB is made up of eminent scholars and practitioners from different disciplines and four continents who have volunteered to provide us both the domain expertise as well as regional perspective to help create a truly globally responsive program. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/35160" target="_blank">more</a></p>

                <p class="cv-summary">Two years ago, I was trying to organize my first Creative Commons-sponsored event, a joint CC-USGS workshop titled Law and the GeoWeb. I ran into Lee in the keynote room at the CODATA conference in Cape Town and asked him to suggest a speaker from Microsoft. Lee said he would do better — he would host the entire workshop at his digs at Microsoft Research in Redmond, WA. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/33994" target="_blank">more</a></p>
