When I got this beauty, she and her brother were just a few weeks old. She was meowing incessantly, so Nes promptly decided to name her "Mew Mew." Mew Mew is not with me anymore, but I recently discovered this photo of her I took a few years ago. The light and dark really exemplify her feline beauty.
