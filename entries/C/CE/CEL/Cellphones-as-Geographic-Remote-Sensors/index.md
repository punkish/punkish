Cellphones already do, or will likely soon be required to, carry location information. In fact, location info of cellphones is going to be the backbone of [Enhanced 911](http://www.fcc.gov/911/enhanced/).

Now, utilizing the phones as environmental sensors sounds quite intriguing. Of course, one is not likely to stick the phone in a mud-swamp and walk away, so they are going to be useful only as very ephemeral sensors.

There is a use for [Streaming Databases] typically in AVL (automated vehicle location) applications when one is tracking moving vehicles, and typically is going to throw away the historical trace. I haven't seen it yet. I have worked on an AVL application, and that jerry-rigged a streaming solution out of an rdbms.

[Intersystems Cach√©](http://www.intersystems.com/cache/) database was used in building an interesting application fir collecting data points streaming from cameras mounted on the helmets of ice-hockey players. Pretty interesting stuff.
