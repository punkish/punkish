 Serve with [Spicy Avocado Sauce] for a real treat.

* 1 lb jumbo lump crabmeat, picked over and coarsely shredded
* 3 T low fat mayonnaise
* 1/4 c minced fresh chives
* 1 T fresh lemon juice
* 1 t Dijon mustard
* 1/4 t black pepper
* 1/2 c panko (Japanese bread crumbs) 
* 1 T unsalted butter
* 2 garlic cloves, smashed
* 1/2 t herbes de Provence or 1/4 t dried thyme
* 1/4 t salt 

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400ºF. Line a baking sheet with foil.

Stir together crabmeat, mayonnaise, chives, lemon juice, mustard, pepper, and 1 tablespoon panko in a large bowl until blended well, then chill, covered.

Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over moderate heat, then cook garlic, stirring, until golden and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add herbes de Provence, salt, and remaining 7 tablespoons panko and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Transfer crumbs to a plate to cool. Discard garlic.

Divide crabmeat mixture into 4 mounds on a sheet of wax paper. Form 1 mound into a patty, then carefully turn patty in crumb mixture to coat top and bottom. Transfer to a baking sheet and repeat with remaining 3 mounds, then sprinkle remaining crumbs on top of crab cakes. Bake until heated through, about 15 minutes. Serve crab cakes with sauce.
