 Time: 30 minutes

For the pudding:

* 3 T butter at room temperature, more for pan
* 0.25 pound fresh chanterelles, cleaned and chopped (1.5 cups) 
* 1 t fresh chopped tarragon leaves 
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
* 8 ears corn 
* 2 large eggs, separated 
* 0.5 c half and half 
* 3 T flour 
* 0.25 t freshly grated nutmeg 
* Pinch cayenne pepper

1. For the pudding: heat 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet until foamy. Add chanterelles and tarragon, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and sautÈ until mushrooms are soft, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside.

2. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan, and remove from heat. Using a sharp knife, slice kernels from each ear of corn. Transfer 3 cups kernels to blender. Set remaining kernels aside. Scrape any remaining corn and milk from each cob into blender. Add egg yolks, half and half, flour, melted butter, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, †1/2 teaspoon salt, and †1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Blend until smooth. Transfer mixture to mixing bowl, and stir in reserved chanterelles and corn.

3. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Butter a 3 quart baking dish or 8 8-ounce ramekins. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites until they hold soft peaks. Fold egg whites into corn mixture, and blend until just incorporated. Spoon pudding into prepared casserole or ramekins. Place casserole or ramekins in a baking dish large enough to allow 1 inch space on all sides. Add hot water to come halfway up sides. Bake until pudding is golden, set in center and nicely puffed, 30 to 40 minutes for a large pudding, 25 minutes for small.

4. About 10 minutes before puddings are done, prepare HerbBraisedChanterelles garnish.

5. Serve pudding with HerbBraisedChanterelles spooned on top. If using ramekins, run a knife around inside edge to loosen pudding, then invert onto plates.

 Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
