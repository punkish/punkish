## Citizens Consent

An idea for more informed citizens based on work done by

* Dan Garon
* Puneet Kishor
* Lysle
* Herrick
* Beth McCarthy

---

## The Problem

* Citizens give up their personal information without fully understanding what will be collected, where it will go, and how it will be used.

* It is hard to understand policies around privacy, sharing and access because they are complicated, non-standard, and perhaps even intentionally obfuscating.

---

## Citizens Consent

* Analogy to *Informed Consent*
* Consent is not good unless the user understands the facts, implications, and  consequences.
* A well-understood and given consent is the right of the citizen and the responsibility of the data collector.

---

## Prior Attempts

* Many attempts at standardizing privacy policies
* Few have gained traction

---

## Solution

* Simple, attractive, visual display of a company's data sharing policiy
* Targeted at average user, and focused on data sharing
* Informative instead of over-whelming
* Backed by a legally-binding policy
