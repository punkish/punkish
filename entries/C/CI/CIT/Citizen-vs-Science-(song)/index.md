<p>
The institution was designed<br>
to cleave the citizen from the science<br>
Now watch the academics then<br>
steal science away from citizens<br>
<br>
To take away what is not theirs<br>
They must pay up for that is fair<br>
But the powerful do make the rules<br>
For science outside and in the schools<br>
<br>
The citizens have to pay the price<br>
To borrow once and share it thrice<br>
But academia gets paid to do<br>
Science in the names of me and you<br>
<br>
In vain they’ll have their lives doth striven<br>
For those who hath more shall be given<br>
And citizens will still lack their share<br>
Unless they claim what is just theirs<br>
