## If You Can Change It, Go Ahead

[Free and Open Source] software and data provide many advantages over more [Restrictive Licensing] of proprietary products. See David A. Wheeler's [Why Open Source Software](http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html).

One of the key advantages, however, is the user's ability to modify and adapt the product to specific needs since the source code of the software, or the data itself, are available, and the freedom to modify them is also available.
