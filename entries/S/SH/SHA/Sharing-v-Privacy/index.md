## The Privacy Imperative v. Emphasizing Sharing

A complex tangle of privacy regulations govern how data with personally identifiable information have to be treated before they can be shared with others. Initiatives such as <a href="http://datatags.org/" target="_blank">Data Tags</a> by the <a href="http://dataprivacylab.org" target="_blank">Harvard Data Privacy Lab</a> are attempting to make the researcher’s life easier by unraveling these requirements, however, the reality is that the complicatedness is merely swept under the carpet.

There is an emerging school of thought that perhaps we are approaching this difficult and trenchant problem the wrong way. Instead of emphasizing the intricacies of privacy to the citizen from whom the data are being sourced, if alongwith providing a reasonable assurance to protect privacy we were to also communicate the potential benefits of sharing, then the citizen would be more inclined to give consent to sharing.
