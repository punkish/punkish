* 4 cups water
* 1 cup wild rice
* 1 red bell pepper
* 3 cups fresh spinach leaves, chopped
* 1 8-ounce can sliced water chestnuts, drained, diced
* 1/2 pound cooked medium shrimp
* 2 celery stalks, sliced
* 2/3 cup chopped green onions
* 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
* 1/4 teaspoon dry mustard
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
* 1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon 

Combine water and rice in heavy medium saucepan. Season lightly with salt and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook until rice is tender, about 40 minutes. Drain and cool.

Meanwhile, char red bell pepper over gas flame or under broiler until blackened on all sides. Place in paper bag and let stand 10 minutes. Peel, seed and chop bell pepper.

Combine wild rice, bell pepper, spinach, water chestnuts, shrimp, celery and green onions in large bowl.

Whisk vinegar and mustard in small bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in olive oil. Add basil and tarragon. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. Add dressing to salad and toss to coat. (Can be prepared up to 4 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) 

 Serves 6.
