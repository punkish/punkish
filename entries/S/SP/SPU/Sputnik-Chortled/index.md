	We are none of us too good enough:
	as runners, we pant and heave heavy thoughts
	as we beat our way across a nondescript finish line,
	and the bold spectators hungrily jeer us on.
	Theirs is a fascinating psychology,
	primal wilderness pulsing
	underneath a well spoken, rational mind.
	They command us
	to coldly dissect
	and peer into the mystical lab charts.
	Let there be a charmless existence,
	or a dullness that aches:
	We will find meaning to this mess.
	
	Sputnik chortled its way to the skies
	leaving behind a world of
	uneasy quiet, bated breath, and
	a desperate rush towards the sciences.
	Like a pink dusted dawn on an empty highway,
	waiting for something -
	to plunge into life.
	That powerful energy that devours us all.
	Sputnik sped away
	and we ran forward
	we runners tripped but hurtled on,
	on towards the Math and Science
	Omnipotent, omnipresent: crack our hearts
	and freeze them.
	Cryogenically save our souls; perhaps we will then be able
	to analyze the specific compounds that react - label, identify,
	and pack them away into neat little jars,
	holed into long laboratory corridors.
	Will our dissected hearts then be able
	to convey their heart-felt condolences to their neighbor,
	the dying rat?
	
	I kick a stone along its path,
	as I wander aimlessly in a national park, does it really matter where?
	The stone has endured the burden of a human footstep
	for generations past, and more to come.
	But it never tells our secrets
	and I hope that it  never will.
	Answers - we race towards them
	because the spectators drag us on - projecting hopes
	of glory, of contentment, of peace.
	I fear what will come when we have the answers.
	Mystery spreads her soft cotton shawl over us,
	gathering us in, and comforting us with words of gentle
	half-truths, and innocent lies.
	Ancient mystery knows our character better than we do 
	the question is:
	does she protect us from the answers,
	or is she protecting the answers
	from us?
	Viruses, gifts, parasites, human beings,
	whatever the latest euphemism for our kind is,
	hear: why complete the finish  line?
	The answers are frighteningly within reach now;
	do we really want it?
	
	Runners, stop this frantic marathon.
	Seize your spectator by the hand and
	gaze at Sputnik together:
	marveling at its beauty, basking in its impossibility.
