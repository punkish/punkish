* 1 lb Fresh green beans
* 2 t sesame seeds
* 1 T sugar
* 2 T rice wine vinegar
* 1/4 t white pepper
* 2 t light soy sauce
* 1/2 t sesame oil
* 2 1/2 T vegetable oil
* 1/2 t salt

The original recipe calls for rice wine; Rice wine vinegar may be substituted.

Trim, wash and parboil beans for 2 minutes in rapidly boiling water. Drain and rinse with cold water.

Heat sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over moderate heat. Remove when seeds begin to pop.

Combine the sugar, rice wine vinegar, white pepper, soy sauce, and sesame oil for the seasoning mixture.

Put a wok on very high heat. When very hot, add oil, salt and then the beans and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the seasoning mixture and stir-fry for another minute. Add sesame seeds and blend well. Transfer to a heated platter.
