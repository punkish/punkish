![Stolen Moments](blues.mp4)

There are few melodies as beautiful as “Stolen Moments” from Oliver Nelson's seminal **Blues and the Abstract Truth**. These gentlemen were jamming under a bridge in Golden Gate Park. I could only see the bass guitar and the drums, and suddenly the saxophone piped in, the musician hidden under the bridge. A couple of minutes of unadulterated beauty.
