Finally, it is out. A result of a lengthy process of "listening," Science Commons is [Announcing the Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data](http://sciencecommons.org/weblog/archives/2007/12/16/announcing-protocol-for-oa-data/). One of the questions asked is, "So how is this different from just giving your data away"? The short answer is that it isn't. The value is in the [Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data](http://sciencecommons.org/projects/publishing/open-access-data-protocol/). Think of it as a mark of certain quality, or certain promises. Once you see this data mark on a dataset, you are absolutely clear of what that dataset stands for.

See [Common Use Licensing of Scientific Data] for background on the workshop that immediately preceded the development of this protocol, and also read about [Scientific Data License] to get a gentle primer on some of the terms and issues.
