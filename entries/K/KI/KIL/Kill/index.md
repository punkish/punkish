the muslim kills the hindu, the hindu kills the sikh  
the sikh who's killed one hundred nine is trying one more trick  
if living bores the weary scores then killing makes them tick.

an arab kills a christian, a christian kills a jew  
the jew is killing the arab, its time for something new.  
if you don't kill then someone will, so you may well kill too.

the northy kills the southy, the southy plants a bomb  
blows up some to kingdom come with a professional's aplomb  
if they won't kill then someone will, so kill and then go home.

a woman kills her husband, the husband kills his miss  
mothers kills there daughters, brothers kill their sis.  
we kill for nothing, kill for that and even kill for this.
