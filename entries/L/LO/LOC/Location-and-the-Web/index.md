The "First International Workshop" on **Location and the Web** aka [Locweb 2008](http://www.locweb.org/) will be held in conjunction with the **WWW 2008 Conference** in Beijing, April 22, 2008



*Due to numerous requests we have extended the submission deadline by one week. Please submit your paper until February 10, the latest.*



The First International Workshop on Location and the Web (LocWeb 2008) focuses on all the geospatial aspects that are related to the Web. A location-aware Web will spawn network effects among geo-referenced data models and services, improving interoperability and interaction by providing a well-defined location concept for the Web. We encourage submissions that will enable mobile search, search in automotive, special local search engines in specialized fields. The workshop will look at the theme of location and the Web from a macro-level, interdisciplinary perspective. In recent years, the topic of location appears in many communities and is achieving great attention - user-generated content, location-related multimedia Web content, Web scale geo-content mining, and mobile search are only some of these developments.
