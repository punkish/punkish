When hell broke loose I lost my ways  
When nights turned long and long were days  

When that I trusted did not pan  
And those who wouldn’t, stopped who can  

Down was up and up was down  
And smiles were all inverted frowns  

It didn't rain for twenty weeks  
And what I sought I couldn’t seek  

It was dry, very dry  
I had tears I couldn’t cry  

My head was dead, my heart was bone  
And rocks were softer than my stone  

Bitterness just filled my brain  
Silent sobs that left their stain  

Then a sliver, slender crack  
Through dark grey clouds peeling back  

A blush that spread on cold dark cheeks  
Signaled warmth that would eke  

A brand new day of gentle calm  
And laughter like a soothing balm  

It was a sign to persist on  
'twas the light at the break of dawn
