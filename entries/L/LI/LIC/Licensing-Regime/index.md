## Restrictive Licensing On Applications And Data



Most applications and data come with an **End User Licensing Agreement** or EULA, which almost no one ever reads. 



Fact is, these EULA are very restrictive. In fact, even though you pay for the application or the data, you don't actually own them. You merely own the right to use them. 



This is analagous to owning a car versus leasing a car. Except, even with a leased car, you are not restricted to where you can drive it. And, you can modify the car, provided you pay for it, at which point you own it. Not so with proprietary software and data.



Such licensing is [Market Driven] not [Client Driven].
