As I got on to my flight  
I saw an unforgetful sight  
That in my dreams I'd always feared  
I saw a lady with a beard

Not a man, not a child  
Not a woman wanton wild  
A sight that in my mind is seared  
It was a lady with a beard

I dared not look but look I dared  
Tried not to but yes I stared  
I couldn't turn away I leered  
At the lady with the beard

I couldn't move like stone was I  
Till I was pushed right in her eye  
By other people I was steered  
Right to the lady with the beard

I braced myself for just in case  
When face to face with face with lace  
Would change to grace just as I neared  
The smiling lady with the beard

I looked at her straight point blank  
But could not find a thing to thank  
I squinted, squeezed my eyes, I peered  
At the lady with the beard

She smiled at me a knowing smile  
Her fleeting smile lasted a while  
To reciprocate I wasn't geared  
To the lady with the beard

I boarded on my aeroplane  
And thought what I could not explain  
My fears, her smile, they were mirrored  
Me, the lady with the beard

Her friendly gaze, my fears, oh why?  
She was more a man than I  
I had to learn to not be scared  
Of the lady with the beard

I squeezed my eyes yet once again  
The dryness in me turned to rain  
My eyes were wet for they had teared  
For the lady with the beard
