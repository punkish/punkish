*Research Assistant*
*Land Information and Computer Graphics Facility (LICGF)*
University of Wisconsin-Madison,

For five years I worked as a Research Assistant on a variety of research projects led by Prof. Bernard Niemann, Jr., and other faculty members at the LICGF.

* Role of the Wisconsin Land Information Program (WLIP) in the diffusion of GIS in the  Wisconsin Counties. 
** WLIP was a program administered by the WI Land Information Association with the intent to encourage land records modernization at the local level.
* Ground and surface water modeling of Dane County, WI. 
** This research was in collaboration with the WI Department of Natural Resources.
* Research on the diffusion of GIS technology at the local-level in India. 
** Inspired by the work being done in Wisconsin, this research was aimed at studying the forces at work encouraging or preventing the modernization of land records in rural India.
