In the 12 years of its existence, Creative Commons has achieved remarkable success, and among the most basic of metrics of its success is the number of CC-licensed works on the web. At last estimated there were 880M+ CC-licensed works making up the “<a href="https://stateof.creativecommons.org" target='_blank'>global commons of CC-licensed information</a>.” The strengths of Creative Commons can be summarized as such:

- globally scalable
- license as opposed to a contract
- universal, unrestricted reproduction
- no registration required

Of the 880M+ CC-licensed works out in the wild, approximately 330M+,[^1] or more than a third, are photographs and similar media. Compared to that, somewhere between 1.5M-2M, or approximately 0.2% of the commons, are open access science papers. The reasons for this skewed profile of the commons are many:

- almost everyone has a tool, a phone with a camera, to create a photograph[^2]
- photographs are easier to create than scientific papers
- photographs are easier to add to the commons with no vetting at source
- a single dominant platform aids in making it easy to contribute photos

[^1]: Estimated ~310M photos in Flickr and ~23M media files in Wikimedia Commons make up the bulk of photos, images and similar files.
