**Axiom 0:** A license, any license, all rights reserved (ARR) or Creative Commons (CC) doesn't guarantee you attribution. Don't be deluded.

**Axiom 1:** A CC license encourages those meaning well to use your work, guides those who are unsure, and doesn't do shit against those with mal-intent

**Axiom 2:** A CC license, or ARR, for that matter, gives you the recourse to sue for attribution, but you really think you will do that?

**Conclusion:** Use a license to allow reuse to send the right signal to good folks, and stop worrying about the bad folks. Behaving well is better than depending on suing.
