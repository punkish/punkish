<i>Thevenot</i> ƒays, this Road (from Delhi to Agra on the South, and to Lahor on the North-weƒt) is infeƒted with Tygers, Panthers, Lions and Robbers of both Sexes, who throw Nooƒes with great dexterity about the Necks of Travellers, ƒtrangle, and rob them. They alƒo plant beautiful Women on the Road to enƒnare Travellers and theƒe Sluts have always Bullies at hand ƒurprize them. Here are many other Towns in this Province, that we can’t inƒiƒt on.
