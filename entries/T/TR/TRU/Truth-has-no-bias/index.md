> Truth has a liberal bias

Perhaps a more correct assessment would be that the desired state of the world by the likes of me has a liberal bias. Truth, by definition, should have no bias, neither liberal nor conservative. Having any kind of bias is problematic because it blinds us to the plights of others different from us. And that does a disservice to the truth as well as to our liberal aspirations. 

There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the likes of me have benefitted greatly from the technological and educational developments of the last 50 years while vast segments of society have been left behind. And that is the source of most of the discord we see today. (Racial hatred mongers and neo-Nazis simply exploit the economic inequality.) We can disagree with them, but we shouldn’t be contemptuous of or ignore them. As Saul Alinsky said, we’ve got to be our brother’s keeper if for no other reason than if we don’t then our brother will turn against us.
