[Increase awareness of text and data mining (TDM)](http://science.creativecommons.org/tdm/) in researchers who may be curious about it and might benefit from it, but don't know enough of it.

1. The idea here is to create an upswell of TDM demand so demand actually drives this area. With more and more researchers wanting to do TDM, there will be pressure on both their institutions and publishers to make TDM possible and easy. Researchers will drive the agenda, as I believe it should be;

2. Explain to them the consequences of restrictive licenses and contracts and educate them on why permissive legal instruments are good for TDM (all publishers are potentially consumers as well, so if we publish our stuff under restrictive licenses, it will come back to bite us in our butts).
