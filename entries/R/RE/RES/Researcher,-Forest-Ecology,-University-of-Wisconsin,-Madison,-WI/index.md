We are implementing computational models for determining carbon and nitrogen budgets of large-scale terrestrial ecosystems. My responsibilities include designing and developing a web-based application for implementing the Biome-BGC model that will run on a computer cluster utilizing open source geospatial and related technologies. I am bringing together the scientific computing aspect of my work with my passion for making all scientific data and technologies freely and openly accessible to everyone.
