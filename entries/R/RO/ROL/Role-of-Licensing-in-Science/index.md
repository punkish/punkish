### A license is a permission to do something

--

### You can only license rights that you have

--

### If you don't apply a license, a default license is applied for you

--

### The default license gives very limited permission to the user

--

### A license, any license, all rights reserved (ARR) or Creative Commons (CC) doesn't guarantee you attribution

--

### A CC license, or ARR, for that matter, gives you the recourse to sue for attribution, but you really think you will do that?

--

### A CC license encourages those meaning well to use your work, guides those who are unsure, and doesn't do anything against those with mal-intent

---

### Use a license to allow reuse to send the right signal to good folks, and stop worrying about the bad folks

--

### Behaving well is better than depending on suing

--

### A copyright license only applies to copyrightable content

--

### Everything is data

--

### It is close to impossible to delineate where raw data (without any copyrightable content) ends and where interpreted data (possibly with copyrightable content) begins

--

### Data are the raw material of science

--

### Information at one level becomes data at another level

--

### Limiting or hindering reuse of data will limit science
