<a href="#prelim_stats">Preliminary stats from the survey</a>
<br>

### A brief survey of the kind of data you use in your daily work

<br>
<form>
<div style='font: normal 8pt "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, "Bitstream Vera Sans", sans-serif; background-image: url(/img/page/Raw_Data_vs_Interpreted_Data/closed.png) '>
<b>Briefly describe the data you use on a routine basis</b> ("Hydrology," "temperature," "income," "disease occurrence," whatever it may be, just be pointed and brief.) <input type="text" size="20" disabled>
<br>
<br>
<b>What format is the above data in when you get it?</b> ("Spreadsheet," "Excel spreadsheet," "database," "raw ASCII," "SQL dump," "Oracle tables," "AVHRR imagery" are all valid answers. State the generic format type, the brand name of the software, or both, as the case may be for you.) <input type="text" size="20" disabled>
<br>
<br>
<b>With regards to the data described above, would you call it "raw" data or "interpreted" data?</b> ("Raw" data are those in which no human creativity was involved. For example, consider readings from a sensor, or census tabulation. Typically, these readings are then processed so they become suitable for human-consumption. For the purpose of this survey, we call these latter "interpreted data." Remember, we are focusing on the data that you get, not what it becomes after you have worked on it.)<br>

<b>Where are you currently located?</b> (Laws governing data and databases vary from country to country. Please enter the country where you are located.) <input type="text" size="20" disabled>
<br>
<br>
From which country did you get the data?</b> (Science is international, so it would help to know if you got the above data from a country different from where you are located.) <input type="text" size="20" disabled>
