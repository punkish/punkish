Scientific authoring workflow is a beast. You keep notes on paper (hopefully, a notebook, and not just loose pages), in word-processing documents unhelpfully named “notes” followed by “notes1,” “notes2” or worse, “notes_old,” “notes_old1.” You manage your bibliography on your desktop or on the web, you have a directory folder full of images, charts, photos and other media, and you collaborate with your co-authors by emailing attachments back and forth.

Sooner or later you start doubting your sanity but you soldier on. Finally you publish your paper, heave a sigh of relief, and move on, thereby ensuring your data can’t be reused and your work can’t be reproduced easily.

Several [coders, designers, scientists, and publishers](https://github.com/scholmd/markdown_science/wiki/people-attending) met at PLOS to brainstorm toward a better, more modern way. The [Markdown for Science workshop](https://github.com/scholmd/markdown_science/wiki) was organized by [Martin Fenner](http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/12/13/a-call-for-scholarly-markdown/) and [Stian Håklev](http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start) and supported by a [1K Challenge Grant from FORCE11](http://www.force11.org/node/4358).

While a lot of good ideas were generated, we have a long way to go. [Keep an eye on this project](https://github.com/scholmd/markdown_science/wiki), and better yet, pitch in with your ideas and code. Together we can tame this beast.
