## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that encompasses a myriad of disciplines focused on improving computer programs to become self-learning.

## Disruptive Power

## Potential for Development

### Decision Making

From self-driving cars on public roads to self-piloting reusable rockets landing on self-sailing ships, machine intelligence is supporting or entirely taking over ever more complex human activities at an ever increasing pace. The greater autonomy given machine intelligence in these roles can result in situations where they have to make autonomous choices involving human life and limb. This calls for not just a clearer understanding of how humans make such choices, but also a clearer understanding of how humans perceive machine intelligence making such choices.

Recent scientific studies on machine ethics have raised awareness about the topic in the media and public discourse. This website aims to take the discussion further, by providing a platform for: 1) building a crowd-sourced picture of human opinion on how machines should make decisions when faced with moral dilemmas, and 2) crowd-sourcing assembly and discussion of potential scenarios of moral consequence.

> Welcome to the Moral Machine! A platform for gathering a human perspective on moral decisions made by machine intelligence, such as self-driving cars. We show you moral dilemmas, where a driverless car must choose the lesser of two evils, such as killing two passengers or five pedestrians. As an outside observer, you judge which outcome you think is more acceptable. You can then see how your responses compare with those of other people.

### Health

The term they’re using here at the World Health Summit is „disintermediation“, as in „doctor disintermediation“

> AI disease modules that allow pathologists to improve the scalability of their work, enabling them to provide better care, at lower cost. Our medium to long-term plan is to develop new treatment paradigms that integrate computational pathology with electronic health records, genomic and other clinical data.

### Self-Driving Cars

### News

> Apple has waded into the messy world of news with a service that is read regularly by roughly 90 million people. But while Google, Facebook and Twitter have come under intense scrutiny for their disproportionate — and sometimes harmful — influence over the spread of information, Apple has so far avoided controversy. One big reason is that while its Silicon Valley peers rely on machines and algorithms to pick headlines, Apple uses humans like Ms. Kern.

## Caveats

Our relationship (humans to machines) is highly asymmetric. Humans behave like humans (forgetful, error-prone, variant, delightful, irritating). Machines are none of those (except, perhaps irritating).
