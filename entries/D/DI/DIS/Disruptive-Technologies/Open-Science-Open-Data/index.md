## Introduction

Open science and open data are terms that describe both the practice and products of science in a way that is participatory, inclusive, open for inspection, and available fo reuse with none to few attached restrictions.

## Disruptive Power

The biggest disruption caused by open science and data, along with open access, is to the traditional scientific publishing industry. With low or even no-cost options to publish, in addition to the pay-once use freely forever model enabled by the author processing charges (APC) powered publishing, publishers are having to adapt their business practices that have traditionally monetized access. But the disruption goes beyond just publishing and cuts through the entire academic system that has traditionally used only journal impact factor and the number of published papers as a benchmark for achievement and promotion. The new models are recognizing alternative metrics and rewarding cooperation, participation and contribution.

## Potential for Development

Free and easy access to scientific literature, data and tools is necessary for a thriving scientific ecosystem. Many institutions in developing countries, even those at the national level, are unable to afford access to expensive Western journals or software. If they do have access, it is usually to outdated versions. Open source, open access, open science and open data not only allow people in developing countries to use these offerings but also to participate in them by contributing back. This is possible because of the permissive reuse licenses under which the open digital content is published. The vastly bigger user population thus made possible results in greater innovation.

Seventy-five countries around the world have signed on to the [Open Government Partnership Declaration](www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration) since 2011. The declaration, which copies the U.S. framework, calls for governments to commit to “pro-actively provide high-value information, including raw data, in a timely manner, in formats that the public can easily locate, understand and use, and in formats that facilitate reuse.”

## Caveats

The most all-encompassing caveat to the use of open science and open data is to pay attention to the quality. While open content promises better quality of results by way of more people being able to look at the underlying source code or data, a move toward new paradigms of review coupled with the more traditional academic pressure to publish can lead to data, tools and literature compromised in quality. Predatory publishers exacerbate the situation by promising exposure to anyone willing to pay their fees without providing any kind of editorial quality control in return. Data bias toward particular race or gender is not particularly specific to open data and science, but is an important danger to guard against.

    <p>The reasons behind the lack of diversity in genome research are many. But they include a past fraught with abuses by Western scientists. One infamous tale involved Arizona State University researchers, who in the 1990s took DNA samples from members of the Havasupai Tribe in Arizona for a study on diabetes, but later used the samples without the tribe’s consent for studies on schizophrenia and patterns of population mixing and migration. In 2010, the Havasupai won a US$700,000 settlement, and the university was forced to return all the samples it had collected.</p>
