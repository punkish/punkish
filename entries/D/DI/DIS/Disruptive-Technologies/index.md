## Background

The World Bank Group has placed a growing emphasis on better understanding the implications of a new world of disruptive technologies that could change development paradigms in fundamental ways. As part of this effort, the Sustainable Development Practice Group has requested the Transport and Digital Development Global Practice to better understand these technologies and their implications, both positive and negative, on sustainable development. This includes an improved understanding of the scale and implications of these disruptive changes, as well as how to help clients get better access to disruptive technologies and institutional arrangements that can help them meet their evolving development challenges, as well as to help clients better buffer themselves against the implications of these changes. These technologies include:

- ✔︎ [Artificial Intelligence](Disruptive-Technologies/Artificial-Intelligence)
- ✘ [Sensors](Disruptive-Technologies/Sensors)
- ✘ [3D Printing](Disruptive-Technologies/3D-Printing)
- ✘ [Blockchain](Disruptive-Technologies/Blockchain)
- ✘ [Open Science and Open Data](Disruptive-Technologies/Open-Science-Open-Data)

## Information Lifecycle

The citizen who is the source of data and the collector of that data, interface at the five points, namely, Ⓐ, Ⓑ, Ⓒ, Ⓓ and Ⓔ as shown in the information lifecycle diagram below

**A**: Explore the potential of changing the conversation from the imperative of protecting privacy to the benefits of sharing. We can call this [Citizens Consent](Citizens-Consent).

**B**: Demystify the terms of data collection, sharing, access, and reuse by simplifying terms of services (TOS), privacy and sharing policies.

**C**: Engage the citizens by involving them in the management and interpretation of the data sourced from them.

**D**: Change the way data are collected and packaged for redistribution and sharing.

**E**: Demystify the Data Use Agreements (DUA).

## Citizens Consent

## Citizens Consent

An idea for more informed citizens based on work done by

* Dan Garon
* Puneet Kishor
* Lysle
* Herrick
* Beth McCarthy

---

## The Problem

* Citizens give up their personal information without fully understanding what will be collected, where it will go, and how it will be used.

* It is hard to understand policies around privacy, sharing and access because they are complicated, non-standard, and perhaps even intentionally obfuscating.

---

## Citizens Consent

* Analogy to *Informed Consent*
* Consent is not good unless the user understands the facts, implications, and  consequences.
* A well-understood and given consent is the right of the citizen and the responsibility of the data collector.

---

## Prior Attempts

* Many attempts at standardizing privacy policies
* Few have gained traction

---

## Solution

* Simple, attractive, visual display of a company's data sharing policiy
* Targeted at average user, and focused on data sharing
* Informative instead of over-whelming
* Backed by a legally-binding policy

## Additional features

* Staged decision-tree to allow web sites and apps to generate the citizens consent report
* Citizen can subscribe and receive notifications when the policy changes
* Auto-generate legally binding data privacy and sharing policies
